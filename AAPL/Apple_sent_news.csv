2,0.6514,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google defended their business practices to U.S. lawmakers conducting a broad antitrust inquiry, seeking to underscore their companies face stiff competition in their respective industries.Amazon, for example, argued that much of the data it keeps regarding third-party merchants who use its online marketplace is public and that analyzing aggregate sales data to bolster its private-label strategy is a common practice in the retail industry.“Customers’ shopping behavior in our store is just one of many inputs to Amazon’s private-label strategy,” David Zapolsky, Amazon’s general counsel, wrote in the letter dated July 26 to U.S. Representative David Cicilline, head of the House antitrust subcommittee. “We also use other factors employed across the retail industry, such as fashion and shopping trends highlighted in the press and on social media, suggestions from our manufacturers for new or complementary product lines, and gaps in our product assortment relative to our competitors.”Amazon said that while it uses aggregate data from merchants, it prohibits the use of individual vendor data in its private-label strategy.The antitrust subcommittee is scrutinizing how Amazon treats its third-party sellers as part of larger probe into the technology industry. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, expressed dissatisfaction with Amazon’s answers at a July 16 hearing before the panel, especially testimony that the company doesn’t use data it collects on sales to favor its products over third-party sellers. The companies, in letters released Tuesday by Cicilline’s office, responded to follow-up questions from the subcommittee.Facebook made the case that it isn’t as dominant as it seems, providing Cicilline with a long list of competitors in different areas. In messaging, for example, the company said it competes with SMS texting, which is used by 4.2 billion people worldwide.Facebook also noted that it’s still possible for outside companies to gain traction quickly in social media. In 2018, TikTok, the Chinese app for short-form video owned by ByteDance Ltd., was downloaded more times than either Facebook or Instagram, becoming a “significant competitor” to Facebook, the Menlo Park, California-based company said.Google maintained that it strives to give users the most relevant information as quickly as possible, which often directs them to other sites. The company also highlighted steps it takes to fight copyright infringement on its video-sharing platform, YouTube.In its response, Google also tried to refute charges that the company favors its own products in search results and on YouTube. In recent years, Google has filled search with more direct answers and Google-run services, like flight bookings, rather than links to outside websites. That trend has prompted several complaints from small companies that depend on Google traffic. Kent Walker, Google’s chief lawyer, wrote that Google “will deliver more traffic to sites across the web,” without citing numbers.Asked how much Google pays Apple Inc to place Google search on iPhones, Walker declined to answer.&#92;--With assistance from Sarah Frier, Ben Brody and Mark Bergen.To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.03,0.929,0.041,1

10,0.992,"Remembering the old adage about stocks falling faster than they rise, investors should be dismayed that Tuesday's rebound did not recoup all of Monday's losses. However, the reasons behind the Tuesday bounce back are, arguably, flimsy.For example, one of today's catalysts was China saying it will not let the yuan depreciate further. That helped for today, but some market observers believe there are trust issues that need to be resolved when it comes to the U.S. and its dealings with China. Another reason equities surged today is the belief that the trade war cannot get much worse. That's a belief rooted in hope, not empirical evidence.Still, the Nasdaq Composite added 1.39% on Tuesday while the S&P 500 rose by 1.31%. Following a day in which all 30 of its components finished in the red, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a Tuesday gain of 1.22%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of today's Dow winners were of the predictable variety and that is OK. Nike (NYSE:NKE) one of the more tariff-sensitive names, jumped 2.95% today. If trade tensions ebb, the athletic apparel maker is likely to recoup some of its recent losses and then some as market participants realize Nike is much more than a China story.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Dow tech names, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), the latter of which is highly tariff-sensitive, finished higher today. Analysts are calling attention to the fact that while the trade war is not good news for Apple, the company is prepared for it. Those preparations may not be factored into Apple stock.&quot;Apple has planned ahead for the protracted trade war and should be able to offset the costs even with higher import costs,&quot; said TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Dow Today: Boeing's BackUnfortunately, I don't mean that the stock is back, though shares of Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) gained 0.47% today. I mean that the Dow's largest component is back in this space. Boeing's recent slide, one that has seen the stock tumble 7% over the past month, has the shares residing below its key moving averages, prompting some questions about the stock's technical health.&quot;The 50-day moving average price of Boeing shares also dipped below the 200-day moving average in June--a signal technical traders will look at for signs of a shift in investor sentiment,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;When the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, it is a sign that a stock has positive momentum and that good news is propelling shares higher.&quot; Dow After The BellAs I noted yesterday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports quarterly results today after the close of U.S. markets. The stock gained 2.64% today in advance of that update. For its fiscal third quarter, Disney is expected to earn $1.72 a share on revenue of $21.4 billion. A year earlier, the company earned $1.87 a share on revenue of $15.4 billion.Disney has a history of retreating immediately following its earnings reports. If history repeats, that could be a buying opportunity in the entertainment giant's shares because the stock closed more than 10% below the average analyst price target today. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodaySomething interesting about China's effort to devalue its currency: the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, is lower by a third of percent over the past week.Behind the scenes, China was likely hoping that its yuan devaluation efforts would send the dollar soaring, further crimping U.S. exporters, but that has not yet materialized. Even if the greenback gains strength on the back of the trade war, that is an impetus for the Federal Reserve to get involved and lower interest rates again, also known as good news for stocks.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

You see them on the cable business channels, warning, with a wild look in their eyes, of a &quot;stock market crash.&quot;Source: Shutterstock But then you look at your portfolio and note that we're in the middle of perhaps the greatest bull run in history.Plus, we've got low interest rates, an economy firing on all cylinders, and a business-friendly administration in the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently hit 27,000 for the first time ever -- and remains near record highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the bears have a point.As sure as you can count on the moon and the seasons moving in cycles, you can count on the stock market moving in cycles. It's been doing it for hundreds of years. Times of economic boom and soaring stock prices are followed by times of economic bust and plummeting stock prices.The pattern has been repeating itself since the founding of the United States.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Economic recessions… real estate busts… stock market crashes… wars… financial shocks. These aren't aberrations. In fact, they are common occurrences. A quick tour of American history shows how this is the case.During the 110 years from 1900 to 2010, we've had…  * The Great Depression  * Two world wars  * More than 30 bear markets (market drops of more than 20%)  * The runaway inflation of the 1970s  * The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s  * The 2000-'02 dot-com crash  * The 2007-'08 financial crisis and resulting Great RecessionThat's not even mentioning the 22 other &quot;run of the mill&quot; recessions that cropped up along the way. Any student of economic and stock market history will tell you that massive financial shocks and stock market crashes happen a lot more often than most people think. In fact, you should expect to see at least one economic shock and bear market per decade.With this in mind, let's go back to 2007… right before the stock market crashed. The 2008 Financial Crisis and Stock Market CrashIn 2007, we had a strong recovery after a crisis. We had excessive levels of debt.If that scenario sounds familiar, it's because the current economic and stock market climate has some important things in common with the one in 2007.We've recovered from a crisis and enjoyed years of good times. Student debt, consumer debt, and risky corporate debt levels are very high. And just like in 2007, stock valuations are near record highs. While the stock market could continue rising for months or even a year or more, it makes a lot of sense to create or review your plan for surviving a bear market. History shows it's just a matter of time before one strikes.While I don't think we're going to get a &quot;whopper&quot; like the 2007-'09 stock market crash anytime soon, a relatively mild drop of 25% or so is overdue.So what should you do to prepare for the next stock market crash?Smart investors prepare themselves for all possibilities -- especially when their retirement savings are at stake. Even a relatively minor market dip of 20% could set your retirement back several years or more. That's why I've put together this three-part plan to insure your investments if the stock market plunges.Knowing about and using these strategies could mean the difference between having an abundant retirement and barely getting by in your old age. Bear Market Survival Strategy 1: Diverse Asset AllocationOf all the concepts that can help you survive and thrive during tough times and full stock market crashes, few are more powerful than &quot;asset allocation.&quot;Intelligent asset allocation means you don't bet the farm on a single stock or a single asset class. Intelligent asset allocation can prevent you from suffering catastrophic losses.Consider people who went &quot;all in&quot; on real estate in 2005 and '06&#92;. Back then, the U.S. real estate mania was in full force. Real estate was a &quot;can't lose&quot; bet. Many people put all their savings into real estate and even took on loads of debt to &quot;leverage&quot; their returns.When the real estate market crashed, these all-in real-estate players were wiped out. At the heart of their downfall was poor asset allocation. They bet the farm on one asset class and it was a bubble.There's no &quot;one size fits all&quot; asset allocation strategy that is right for everyone.However, most of us have similar end goals. We want to own a diversified collection of assets that throws off lots of income… even when we are not actively working. We want to buy high-quality assets for bargain prices. We want our portfolio to be crisis-proof and inflation-proof. Bear Market Survival Strategy No 2: Buy Some GoldThere are hundreds of wealth-insurance policies out there. They involve intricate details, lots of forms to sign, and payments of big fees to advisors and salesmen (which are often the same thing).But I'd rather keep things simple and keep money in my pocket instead of a salesman's pocket.Put a small portion of your wealth in gold bullion.People would likely flock to gold in a global financial disaster or stock market crash and cause its price to soar. For example, the 1970s were marked by war, recession, and high inflation. This made the 1970s a terrible decade for stocks and bonds. But it was terrific for gold owners. As people fled stocks for precious metals, gold gained more than 2,000% during the decade.Stocks Zig, Gold Zags : The rolling two-year investment returns of the S&P 500 and goldThe good news is that you don't have to buy a huge amount of gold to have a good insurance policy. You can place just 5% of your portfolio into gold.Gold's place in your portfolio could be the difference between your family struggling to get by and or doing well. Bear Market Survival Strategy 3: Invest for the Long TermFinding real stock market bargains is usually difficult because financial markets correctly price most assets most of the time.However, a crisis creates massive empire-building opportunities because it introduces tremendous amounts of emotion into the financial markets.A crisis creates panic. When people panic, they dump their ownership stakes in stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities with little regard to their real values or ability to produce income. They sell first and ask questions later. This creates huge declines in asset prices and huge volatility.This, of course, means that if you can keep your head while others are losing theirs, you can buy assets at fire-sale prices.For example, the wake of the 2008 credit crisis was an amazing time to buy business like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Altria Group (NYSE:MO) (the world's largest cigarette maker), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Apple tripled in value off its 2009 bottom in less than two years. Altria doubled off its bottom in about two years. Starbucks more than tripled in value off its bottom in about two years.During a financial crisis, essential assets like factories, skyscrapers, mines, oil fields, farms, pipelines and power plants don't dry up and blow away. The only thing that changes about these valuable, lasting assets is who owns them.The financial markets are like a chess game. During a crisis, the ownership of essential assets moves from weak players to strong players. One More Way to Prepare for the Next Stock Market CrashAs I mentioned at the start of this report, it's just a matter of time before we experience another bear market or full stock market crash.That's why I've spent the past year and more developing Bear Market 2020: The Survival Blueprint.This book is full of hard-won knowledge and more advanced strategies than the ones I've shared with you so far. I've tested these tactics in the bloody trenches of firsthand investing, and in it I tell some of my &quot;war stories&quot;… and prove these tactics work. Part &quot;diary&quot; and part &quot;owner's manual,&quot; Bear Market 2020 takes you by the hand and walks you, step-by-step, through the six tactics that will help you and your family navigate America's next bear market.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now History shows that it's only a matter of time before the next financial shock.

13,0.9926,"Like usual, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock delivered an impressive quarterly report, producing both an earnings beat and a continuing path to profit growth amid increased competition.Source: Shutterstock However, CMCSA barely reacted to the news. It also fell in subsequent days along with the market. Although Comcast stock offers a cheap valuation and double-digit growth, the equity is poorly positioned to deliver shareholder return at current levels. Comcast Seems SolidIn many respects, investors should congratulate the management of Comcast. Despite Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) disrupting its cable TV industry, Comcast has thrived through internet service and becoming a content provider of its own. While TV subscriptions continue to fall in line with the cord-cutting trend, the company continues to add internet customers. Moreover, as the owner of NBC as well as Universal Pictures and its theme parks, it becomes a viable competitor to Disney (NYSE:DIS).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, our own Josh Enomoto pointed out that Comcast stock &quot;needs some new catalysts.&quot; He could not be more right.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now As Enomoto stated, Comcast gave investors a solid yet lackluster earnings report in July. Although the company missed on revenue, it beat Wall Street estimates and added more subscribers than analysts had expected. The company also maintained its quarterly dividend payment of 21 cents per share. This payout has risen for eight straight years and pays a yield of 2%. But CMCSA Stock Lacks an Obvious CatalystSo what?A 2% yield amounts to Comcast stock slightly beating the S&P 500 average. Like its dividend, I expect the company to continue growing, but not on an impressive scale. The company needed to replace its lagging pay-TV content with a streaming service and is doing so. Moreover, it will have to compete not only with Netflix and Disney, but also Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV service and several others.Even if Comcast's streaming service succeeds, it will not command the revenues that cable TV service brought in its heyday. Enomoto argues that Comcast stock supports less lucrative theme parks and content businesses compared to Disney. Again, I have to agree. The One Thing That Could Invigorate Comcast StockHowever, Comcast stock could have a potential catalyst in its valuation. CMCSA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 12.2. Moreover, profit growth has remained robust. Consequently, analysts expect earnings increases of 20% this year and 11.1% in fiscal 2020.This makes Comcast stock a bargain, but one I would not buy at this moment. The Federal Reserve rate cut and the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war has brought a generalized stock selloff. CMCSA will fall with almost every other stock under this circumstance.Still, its P/E ratio has averaged around 16.3 over the last five years, well above current levels. The CMCSA stock price stands just above the $41 per share level as of the time of this writing. Investors should also note the stock trades near all-time highs currently. Comcast stock bounced back in both 2016 and 2018 when it reached the low-$30s-per-share level. Hence, traders are now dealing with a range-bound equity.A return to the low-$30s-per-share floor would bring the P/E ratio into the single digits and create a buying opportunity. Moreover, if it sustained itself above the $45.30 per share all-time high and broke this price ceiling, it would probably become a buy as well.Comcast has given little indication it will generate excitement in the coming years. However, at the right price, CMCSA stock could deliver the excitement the company has not.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

I want you to keep your head while others are losing theirs.You see, panic creates opportunities.For example, the wake of the 2008 credit crisis was an amazing time to buy business like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Altria Group (NYSE:MO) (the world's largest cigarette maker), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Apple tripled in value off its 2009 bottom in less than two years. Altria doubled off its bottom in about two years. Starbucks more than tripled in value off its bottom in about two years.Days like this are the best time to add to your holdings in what I call &quot;Forever Stocks.&quot; These are stocks and funds that you hold through good times and bad -- especially if they pay a steadily rising dividendI tell my readers all the time that they should think of these investments as their core holdings. Treat these Forever Stocks as your &quot;Elite 8&quot; or &quot;Top 10&quot; -- or whatever number you decide on. In my experience, eight to 10 stocks are ideal. In total, these stocks should represent about 25% to 35% of your total portfolio.These are the stocks you hold through thick and thin, unless the rationale for owning them changes significantly or you decide to replace one of them with a different stock.And then you buy more of them when opportunity strikes -- days when the market drops. After all, buying a great stock near a major peak is less ideal than buying it near a major low. Fantastic Gains in StoreWe are still near the market's peak, but the investment gains that can accrue from buying an excellent stock at even the worst times can be astonishing. Many, many times, my most outstanding investments started off miserably.In 1999, I produced an institutional research product in which I recommended buying shares of Royal Garden Resorts (now known as Minor International), a Thai hospitality company.Two years after I recommended it, the stock was down 37%. But I held on.And despite this dismal start, Royal Garden went on to post gains of:  * 100% after three years  * 500% after six years  * 1,000% after seven years  * 2,000% after eight years  * 2,888% after nine yearsAlso in 1999, I recommended buying shares of Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY), the German shoe manufacturer. It, too, plummeted shortly after my recommendation. Two years later, the stock was still down 50%.But after 18 years, the stock had become a 10-bagger -- up more than 1,000%. That result was six times better than what the S&P 500 delivered over the same time frame.In hindsight, I recommended both of these stocks at &quot;the wrong time.&quot; And yet, both of them went on to produce large, market-beating returns. It Will Happen AgainEven if the latest opportunity has passed, panic will strike again. After all, stock market crashes and other financial shocks aren't aberrations. They are common occurrences. Just look at American history over the past 120 years or so.During the last big market crash -- 2007-2008 -- instead of panicking, I showed my readers how to short dozens of the big banks and mortgage companies that eventually went bust.People who followed my recommendations could have walked away with gains like 1,415% on Countrywide Financial, 4,408% on Fannie Mae, and even 6,425% on Freddie Mac.Smart investors prepare themselves for all possibilities -- especially when their retirement savings are at stake -- because even a relatively minor decline of 20% could set your retirement back several years or more.That's why I've spent the past year and more developing Bear Market 2020: The Survival Blueprint.Part &quot;diary&quot; and part &quot;owner's manual,&quot; in Bear Market 2020 I take you by the hand and walk you, step-by-step, through the six tactics that will help you and your family navigate America's next bear market.History shows that it's only a matter of time before the next financial shock.

Utilities say the new networks threaten to create interference that could make it harder to keep the lights on.“Opening the 6 GHz band to unlicensed users could cause interference with our signals and could jeopardize the reliability of our communications network,&quot; said Mike Twomey, a senior vice president for federal policy and government affairs for New Orleans-based Entergy.As wires increasingly go the way of rotary phones, nearly every industry is trying to push into underused spectrum space. The number of Wi-Fi hotspots globally is forecast to grow sixfold by 2021 as fifth-generation, or 5G, cellular networks take shape to underpin everything from autonomous vehicles to industrial robots, according to the Federal Communications Commission. That means opening more space on the radio spectrum.The airwaves in the 6 gigahertz range used by utilities, pipeline operators, police and fire departments and others happen to be ideally positioned on the spectrum to accommodate 5G networks. Tech and telecom companies say technology exists to open them up without interfering with emergency services.“It’s no longer feasible for a band like this with so much potential for sharing to remain with existing incumbents and no additional usage,” said Alice Tornquist, vice president of spectrum strategy and technology policy at Qualcomm Inc., the chip giant.Facebook declined to comment. Apple did not respond.FCC PriorityThe debate comes as the FCC is under orders from Congress to open up more airwaves for broadband service. The move “could be a big boost to our nation’s 5G future,” the agency’s Chairman Ajit Pai said last year as it proposed the change.Aside from their concerns about interference, utilities say the FCC seems to be rushing its proposal through.“Keeping the 6 GHz band is critical to the reliability of the electric grid,” said Joy Ditto, who heads the Washington-based Utilities Technology Council. “There’s no ready replacement.”Neil Grace, an FCC spokesman, said opening those airwaves “will allow a valuable spectrum resource to be more intensively used to benefit consumers.” The move, he said, would not cause interruptions for existing users.A spokeswoman for Duke Energy Corp., however, said the FCC’s proposed approach would not shield utilities from harmful interference. “Any benefit from the expansion of the band would be outweighed by the threat of interference to electric utilities’ communications systems,” Duke’s Catherine Butler said.Congress WatchingThe debate has spilled into Congress. In June, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, expressed concerns about the move in a letter to Pai. “The communication assets installed on the power grid are designed to ensure reliability,” she wrote. “It is important to recognize that electricity service in a region cannot be compromised in an effort to make 6GHz more broadly available.’’The issue has spurred calls for more coordination between the FCC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees utilities. FERC Commissioner Bernard McNamee said it’s crucial that both agencies apply the same standards when it comes to communications used by utilities. “The consequences of confusion could be detrimental to the electric grid and ultimately the American people,” he said in an email.Under a worst-case scenario, utilities may be forced to switch to laying expensive fiber wire to replace wireless communications, according to Entergy, which owns utilities serving Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. That could cost customers tens of millions of dollars, Twomey said.“If the FCC plans to move forward on this, we want it tested and want to be part of the testing to make sure the interference can be mitigated,’’ said Brian O’Hara, senior director of regulatory issues at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.(Adds utility statement from Duke Energy in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Todd Shields and David R.

It sells at 16.5 times earnings, with a dividend of 77 cents per share yielding 1.6%.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long So far in 2019 Disney stock has outperformed Apple, a gain of 28% against Apple's 23.7%.Which would you rather have? The Case for Disney StockDisney is due to report earnings after the market closes Aug. 6, with $1.71 per share on $21.44 billion in revenue expected.  Last year's numbers were $1.91 per share of earnings but just $15.2 billion in revenue.Disney dominates the movie and theme park markets. With its acquisition of Fox's movie assets now complete, Disney now has 38% of the box office, more than twice Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) NBC Universal, which has just 14%. Eight of the 10 best-attended theme parks in the world belong to Disney.Last quarter's disappointing results from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which had its first loss of U.S. subscribers and could suffer more as studios like Disney pull their content, has analysts believing in Disney's Disney+ offering. It will launch November 12 at $7 per month, almost half what Netflix costs. The Case Against Walt Disney StockDisney+ needs to be a hit, because TV revenue has flattened out. Broadcast and cable TV still represent more than one-third of Disney's revenue, and were over half its earnings in the last quarter.The transition is underway, and if the experience of ESPN is any indication, it is going to be painful.Disney hopes to replace the $9 per month it gets from cable operators for ESPN with ESPN+, which currently costs $5 per month. That service passed 2 million subscribers in February, helped by a $1.5 billion investment in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Disney used to list revenue from toys, games and videogames in its earnings report, but now reports that with the theme parks as &quot;parks, experiences and products.&quot; Disney said its games business showed a gain last quarter from the sale of rights to Kingdom Hearts II. The lack of a game studio has long been a weakness for the company. Trouble in China?Apple shares have been weak lately because of the China trade war, but Disney stock price is vulnerable there as well. Disneyland has two theme parks in China, both 57% owned by government entities.Disney is also facing increasing competition at the Chinese box office from titles like &quot;Ne Zha,&quot; now forecast to out-earn even &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; in that market. Disney takes the China market seriously and recently launched its reboot of &quot;The Lion King&quot; in China a week ahead of its U.S. premiere. The Bottom Line on Walt Disney StockDisney continues to execute its pirouette away from cable and broadcast toward streaming, to the cheers of analysts everywhere. Most rate Disney stock as a buy.But Disney is doing all this without a net. It has just $10 billion in cash and lists almost $38 billion in borrowings on its balance sheet, thanks to the Fox acquisition. One-third of its $214 billion in assets is listed as &quot;goodwill.&quot; If you're still comparing the two, Apple has about $245 billion in cash.

30,0.9968,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vivendi SA’s seemingly discordant search for an investor in Universal Music Group seems finally to have struck a positive note.The French media conglomerate is in preliminary talks to sell a 10% stake in the world’s biggest record label to Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., the Paris-based firm said on Tuesday. The deal would give the star asset – whose stable of artists include Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and U2 – an equity valuation of 30 billion euros ($34 billion).The discussions come just over a year after Vivendi said it planned to sell as much as 50% of UMG: the process has been very much an adagio. An impending agreement will therefore be welcomed by shareholders.The tie-up makes a lot of sense for Vivendi, which is controlled by the billionaire Vincent Bollore. It highlights the underlying value of UMG and secures a new partner that might help it expand in China.Before Tuesday’s announcement, Vivendi’s total market capitalization was just 29 billion euros. A subsequent stock crescendo pushed that beyond the UMG valuation, but still implies that assets accounting for about 40% of profit – spanning the Canal+ broadcast group, Havas advertising agency, Gameloft video game studio, Editis publishing house and more – represent a far smaller fraction of the company’s overall value.The sticker price for UMG might be generous. Private equity investors had backed out earlier this year after balking at the price, Bloomberg News reported.  Tencent’s offer is in the middle of the broad span of valuations for the business, which ranged from as little as 20 billion euros to as much as 44 billion euros. Still, for the Chinese giant, 3 billion euros is a negligible price to pay for a seat at the music industry’s top table and to secure preferential treatment as it expands into new markets. It has $26 billion in cash and analysts forecast $15 billion of free cash flow this year.Strategically, Tencent is a more useful partner for Vivendi than other mooted (if unlikely) investors: Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Asia represented just 13% of UMG’s 2018 sales – there’s plenty of room for growth. Tencent Music Entertainment Group, which the Chinese firm controls, owns some of the country’s biggest music streaming services.Vivendi is optimistic that Tencent, with its dominant social network and keen understanding of the Chinese market, can help it expand in the region. It will be interesting to see how or if that works in practice. And other strategic players from the tech industry might be dissuaded from investing now that Tencent is involved, particularly at the same valuation. The concern for investors might be that this deal is the apotheosis for UMG in terms of external investment. It’s well short of the target to sell up to half of the firm. Nonetheless, Vivendi's stock had pared gains this year, partly due to concern about finding any investor at all for the label. Tencent might let the tempo pick up again.&#92;--With assistance from Tim Culpan.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Baker at stebaker@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

However, the opening gap and the sheer scope of the selloff since early last week sets the stage for at least some sort of bullish pushback.Source: Shutterstock Bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the charge, falling more than 5% during the regular hours session on worries that an intensifying trade war would impact it more than others. AAPL stock was down another 2% in Monday's after-hours action. Meanwhile, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was lower by more than 4% on concerns that an economic slowdown and another rate cut could prove problematic for it.Fear more than anything else, however, is what took a toll on the broad market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat doesn't mean it won't continue taking a toll though, leaving traders in something of a lurch as the week continues.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now To that end, it's the stock charts of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), AES (NYSE:AES) and Centurylink (NYSE:CTL) that appear to be best positioned for a reliable swing, even if they all still need the market's cooperation. Centurylink (CTL)Centurylink is a name that has been on the radar since the first quarter of the year. With the most recent look from mid-June, CTL had pushed above a couple of different resistance lines, and was applying pressure to its 50-day moving average line that was acting as a ceiling at the time.The 50-day moving average line has been hurdled in the meantime. In fact, it has since begun acting as support. With just a little more forward progress and a couple more technical leaps that are in the path ahead though, there's little bearish argument that will be left intact.  *   Click to EnlargeThose last two technical events that will proverbially seal the deal on new bullishness are a cross of the purple 50-day moving average above the gray 100-day average line, and a move above the recent ceiling at $12.42 plotted in blue on both stock charts.  * The odds of such a move are strong, given how Centurylink has logged higher lows and higher highs since May's pivot even though the broad market hasn't.  * Although it's not a factor yet, should CTL be able to move above the ceiling at $12.42, the next line to watch is the 200-day moving average line plotted in white on both stock charts. Pfizer (PFE)Undoubtedly it has more to do with the market and with politics than Pfizer itself. Nevertheless, the chart of the drugmaker's stock is what it is. And what it is, is a name that has been severely oversold for a bevy of reasons over the course of the past week.The sheer scope of the selloff is unusual though, setting the stage for a potential bounceback. Underscoring that prospect is where and when PFE stock finally stopped falling on Monday. It's right at one key floor, and close enough to another one to say investors are at least thinking it could be trying to act as support.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale   *   Click to EnlargeThe near-term floor in question is plotted as a falling blue line on both stock charts. Monday's low traces most of the low points seen since late last year.  * Bolstering the bearish case is the purple 50-day moving average line's cross back under the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Nevertheless, the gap left behind with last week's big plunge and the way Pfizer stock is dancing with the support line that tags all the major lows going back to early 2016 suggests this is where the bulls are most likely to take a stand. AES (AES)Finally, AES rolled higher in 2018, seemingly unaffected by the weakness that proved problematic for most other names in the last quarter of last year. This year has been a solid one for AES as well, even with the second-quarter pullback (which was a pullback from a record high).As of Monday though, AES stock is in significant technical trouble. The 3% setback was enough to pull AES stock below a couple of different key support levels. There's still a chance it could snap back into bullish mode, but should AES linger at its current value or make lower lows, there's little left to stop the bleeding.  *   Click to EnlargeOne of the critical support levels that was just shattered is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on the daily stock chart. It had been a technical floor a couple of times in recent months.  * The daily chart's action since mid-June is also telling, in a bearish way. It bounced around between two key moving average lines, but transitioned from a net-bullish to net-bearish mode on Monday.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart, the rising support level that had kept the rally in motion since turning in early 2018 finally failed to keep AES propped up with Monday's setback.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

35,0.9763,"As the trade war escalates, Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares are selling off at an alarming rate. The tech giant, which relies on China for almost 20% of its sales, plummeted by over 5% on August 5. The decline came after China responded to Trump’s tariff threats by allowing the Yuan to fall and suspending U.S. agricultural purchases. The 10% tariffs would be imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese exports that had previously avoided duties. Many investors are concerned that tariffs would cause AAPL to raise the prices of the iPhone and other products as well as affect shipment forecasts. However, one top analyst says not to worry. TF International Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, said on August 5, “Apple has planned ahead for the protracted trade war and should be able to offset the costs even with higher import costs.”Is this enough to reassure investors of Apple’s standing given the uncertain economic climate? Is AAPL Prepared for Tariffs?The biggest question that investors want answered is whether or not APPL will take on the 10% tariff on assembled iPhones imported from China? Or if the cost will get passed on to consumers.  The company already assumes the cost of all tariffs placed on certain iPhone and iPad cases imported from China. However, additional tariffs could cause earnings and margins to take a massive hit. One analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, calculated that if AAPL eats the full cost, its earnings will drop 7% with margins also declining by 1.5 percentage points. “Apple will have to calculate how much iPhone sales will decline if it passes the cost of the tariff onto consumers. Anything larger than a 20% drop and Apple will be better off eating the cost of the tax itself. And ironically, there is a risk that China will also tax the iPhone as a U.S. import in retaliation,” the Bernstein analyst said on August 5. He gives AAPL a Hold rating and $190 price target, suggesting 2% downside.  If AAPL increased prices, Wedbush analyst, Daniel Ives, predicts iPhone sales will fall by 6 to 8 million in the U.S. next year. However, if the company absorbs the costs, it could cut Apple's earnings by 4% in 2020. “While Apple will be able to mitigate some of the cost increases from tariffs by adjusting its supply chain, the process is slow-going,” he said on August 2. Despite his warnings, he keeps a Buy rating and price target of $245, suggesting 27% upside potential. To avoid the price hike of products sold in the U.S., Apple will have to increase manufacturing outside of China. While Apple designs its products in the U.S., they are assembled primarily in China. The company does manufacture a small number of iPhones in India, but that facility alone wouldn’t be able to match the amount produced in China. AAPL plans to combat this by expanding production to additional countries such as Vietnam. According to current analyst estimates, iPhone production outside of China could increase to 25% by 2020.Kuo claims that if Apple reaches this figure, it will be able to meet the demand from the U.S. market after two years. “The negative impact on Apple are limited and temporary because the profit from service business is growing, and non-Chinese production locations will gradually increase,” he said on August 5. The analyst adds that the company’s brand image and relationships with suppliers could improve if it eats the tariff costs.  Other Analysts Weigh InOther top analysts tell investors to also buy AAPL during the pullback. J.P. Morgan is one of the firms advocating on behalf of the tech company. “Expect Apple to absorb tariff impact and prioritize market share, implies -8% EPS headwind. However, we believe Apple is more likely to absorb all the tariff impact and not raise prices on iPhone shipments (roughly 35% of total) and other hardware devices into the US, which we estimate will lead to a ~300 bps headwind to iPhone margins,&quot; said Samik Chatterjee on August 5. The analyst kept his Buy rating and $239 price target, suggesting 24% upside.On August 5, Merrill Lynch analyst, Wamsi Mohan, said whatever Apple decides to do will be manageable and noted that now is a good entry point for investors. “In the broader context of the tailwinds that AAPL has we view this as a relatively small amount over the next several quarters and would use the pullback as an especially attractive opportunity to buy shares of Apple,” the analyst said. He maintains his Buy rating and $240 price target, indicating 24% upside. The Bottom Line The Street is cautiously optimistic on the tech stock despite trade tensions. AAPL has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $222 average price target, suggesting 15% upside potential.",0.043,0.882,0.076,1

42,0.999,"(Bloomberg) -- When Ali Tutuncu found a vulnerability in Capital One Financial Corp.’s software in March, the company fixed the flaw in 20 days. An independent security researcher, Tutuncu said the bank thanked him and added him to its page of fame.“They did not pay financially,” he said. “Still, it was a nice experience.”Capital One is among a relatively small group of major companies that are encouraging the typically anti-establishment hacker community -- and security researchers too -- to find potential vulnerabilities in their computer networks before malicious hackers do. Some of the programs offer cash rewards, called bug bounties, of as much as $200,000.The bank is crediting its Responsible Disclosure Program with helping them track down a Seattle woman who had allegedly infiltrated their computer network. Paige Thompson, 33, allegedly accessed a massive amount of data: more than 100 million people, including names, addresses, dates of birth and about 140,000 Social Security numbers.That’s a black eye for a company that’s touted its tech savviness, and the hack has sent Capital One Shares tumbling 11% in the last week. But it appears the damage could have been worse: Capital One said it was unlikely the information was used for fraud or disseminated to others.Thompson was charged on July 29 with computer abuse and fraud. Her arrest marks a major success for cyber tip lines, and one that is likely to encourage other companies to start their own. Paul Benda, senior vice president of risk and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association, said he couldn’t recall tip that was wrapped up so quickly.“From the time they submitted to the time it was submitted, to the time it was shut down to the time there was an arrest, there’s no example I think that comes close to that,” he said.Alex Rice, co-founder and chief technology officer of HackerOne Inc., which manages “hacker-powered security” platforms for Capital One and other companies, said, “Usually vulnerability disclosure programs are not uncovering criminal activity. But it is phenomenal that it works out that way.”Jennifer Bayuk, a former risk cybersecurity executive at several major banks including JP Morgan Chase & Co., said if banks don’t already have vulnerability disclosure programs, they are likely looking at them now. “They’re probably looking at the Capital One news and meeting with legal as we speak.”There appears to be plenty of room for growth. A 2018 HackerOne report concluded that 93% of the world’s largest public companies don’t have a policy to handle “critical bug reports” submitted by outsiders.The tip that led to Thompson’s arrest came in on July 17, when an unnamed “external security researcher” emailed Capital One’s disclosure program saying that leaked data was being stored on a publicly accessible file at GitHub, which allows users to manage and store software projects.Capital One provided few details when asked about its cyber tip line. A public page about the bank’s program at HackerOne shows that it has received at least 30 reports of security flaws since it started in January. HackerOne declined to say how many of those reports were validated security flaws.“White Hat” hacker programs have been around for years, but they have become more formalized as the volume and severity of threats has increased. Some companies manage their own vulnerability disclosure efforts. Companies like HackerOne and BugCrowd offer services to analyze incoming tips and, if warranted, pass them on to their client’s security team.“You have to filter it out pretty carefully before you realize what’s real and what’s not,” said Dave Aitel, chief technical officer at Cyxtera Technologies, which provides security for computer networks and cybersecurity services.Crowdsourcing SecurityVulnerability disclosure programs allow companies to crowdsource security, tapping researchers with a diverse background of skills to stress test computer infrastructure. Ethical hackers and security researchers with specialized skills may discover a flaw that a company’s internal security team missed, or a flaw that may have not been included within the scope of a bank’s security risk assessment, Bayuk said.The programs run from invitation-only disclosure programs, which are often used by companies in regulated spaces like financial services and health care, to tip lines that are open to all comers. It’s seen as an alternative to traditional “penetration testing,” where companies hire outside firms to test the security of its networks.Some companies, like Capital One, provide policies agreeing not to prosecute security researchers for finding bugs in its systems as long as they abide by specific protocols.Still, inviting hackers to rummage through a computer network isn’t without some risks, since they could come across customer identities or even potentially damage the system, Bayuk said. If a hacker or security researcher were to come across personally identifiable information on Capital One’s services, the company advises them to immediately purge the data and contact the company, according to the program guidelines.Some financial intuitions stop short of offering financial rewards due to a fear it could encourage criminal behavior, Bayuk said.Bug BountiesBut organizations that offer financial rewards to hackers or security researchers typically get more tips, Bayuk said. The amount of the bug bounties depend on the quality of the information provided by the tipster and the severity of the hack, and rewards range from a couple hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.Apple Inc., for instance, will pay out as much as $50,000 for pointing out a bug that allows a hacker to access iCloud account data on Apple servers, and as much as $200,000 for vulnerabilities in its secure boot firmware components, which blocks malware when a phone starts, according to the company’s iOS security guide. On Monday, Microsoft Corp. announced that it was doubling the top bounty reward, to $40,000, for finding bugs in Azure, the company’s competitor to Amazon Web Services.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has had a private disclosure program in place since January 2018 and awarded $40,500 since it was started, said Patrick Lenihan, a bank spokesman. Goldman offers a maximum payout of $15,000 to people who identify vulnerabilities, though awards are usually around $1,000, Lenihan said.In recent weeks, it also started a public program -- offering incentives to people who identify flaws such as “unauthorized access to sensitive information.” It too has a maximum reward of $15,000 but that’s likely to increase as it expands, Lenihan said.‘Thank-you T-shirt’Even if Capital One offered cash rewards, it’s not clear that the unnamed tipster would have netted a huge reward. That’s because the information provided was more of a heads-up about a leaked data, rather than a detailed report outlining a major flaw, Aitel said.“You’re not gonna make a ton of money saying, ‘Hey, I think someone has your information on a Github account,’ ” he said, adding, “They might send you a thank you T-shirt. They definitely owe you a thank you T-shirt.”To contact the reporters on this story: William Turton in New York at wturton1@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Martin at amartin146@bloomberg.net, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.053,0.795,0.153,1

But subscribing to a short in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and profiting from an increasingly bearish situation off and on the price chart in NFLX stock looks even better. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock A questionable rate cut and retaliation from both investors and China to Tariff Man have played key roles in the S&P 500 index's slide of 5% over the past week and heavyweights like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) dropping roughly 7.5% to 12% respectively. Caught squarely in the middle and off about 10% is NFLX stock.But don't let the average performance fool you -- NFLX shares have been and continue to look decidedly more bearish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Since Netflix's mid-July earnings confessional crashed shares after surprisingly weak subscription data raised competition concerns from Disney (NYSE:DIS), AT&T (NYSE:T) unit HBO, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others, it's been a tough environment for NFLX stock bulls. Over that period shares are off 16%. It gets worse, though.If investors look back slightly longer to Netflix's relative high in early July, shares have slid almost 21%. To be sure, that's no small loss in shareholder value. But be warned, this bearish chapter appears to be just getting started. NFLX Stock Weekly Price ChartAll markets correct at one time or another. And while Netflix's 6,300% gain over the past decade might appear immune to that market truth, it's not. In fact, with shares signaling out of a bearish flag centered on the NFLX base's 50% level and beneath weekly chart lateral support, as well as the 200-day simple moving average--a larger bearish phase could be underway. I certainly wouldn't bet against it right now.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 My recommendation is to short NFLX stock today. I'd suggest a stop-loss of around 11% and size the short accordingly. This exit attempts to get a bearish short past any adverse daily chart volatility and only close the position if the recent pattern high, plus a bit of wiggle room, are broken.If NFLX stock begins to move aggressively lower in the coming weeks and months, taking profits in zone support which stretches from $200 - $231 makes sense. This area is backed by the December bottom, 62% retracement level dating to Netflix's three-year cycle low, whole number psychology and potentially sets up a powerful double-bottom price pattern. And in total, that makes for a much more interesting story-line for bullish investors to subscribe, too.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

57,0.959,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. will let Alexa users opt out of human review of their voice recordings, a move that follows criticism that the program violated customers’ privacy.A new policy took effect Friday that allows customers, through an option in the settings menu of the Alexa smartphone app, to remove their recordings from a pool that could be analyzed by Amazon employees and contract workers, a spokeswoman for the Seattle company said. It follows similar moves by Apple Inc. and Google.Bloomberg first reported in April that Amazon had a team of thousands of workers around the world listening to Alexa audio requests with the goal of improving the software. Their tasks include listening to and transcribing voice recordings. Some of the workers reviewing customer recordings had access to certain personal data, including users’ first names and their location.At the time, Amazon and people familiar with the program said only a small sample of recordings were manually reviewed. Bloomberg reported that similar human review is used for Alphabet Inc.’s Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri. Recent news reports elaborated on the extent of those companies’ review programs.Google’s decision to halt its review process was disclosed after a German privacy regulator started investigating the program. Apple said it was suspending its manual review of Siri queries on Thursday. Amazon declined to comment on whether the company had been contacted by regulators about its program.“We take customer privacy seriously and continuously review our practices and procedures,” the Amazon spokeswoman wrote in an email Friday. “We’ll also be updating information we provide to customers to make our practices more clear.”The manual review practice by Amazon wasn’t previously disclosed in the product’s terms and conditions. Amazon now says the Alexa app will include a disclaimer in the settings menu acknowledging that people might review recordings through Alexa. Users who tap “Settings,” “Alexa Privacy” and then “Manage How Your Data Improves Alexa” are greeted with new language: “With this setting on, your voice recordings may be used to develop new features and manually reviewed to help improve our services. Only an extremely small fraction of voice recordings are manually reviewed.”(Corrects when Google stopped conducting human reviews in the fifth paragraph from a story published Aug. 2.)To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Mark Milian, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.023,0.894,0.083,1

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) surged past that market cap a month later on September 4, 2018. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the $1 trillion club in April of this year. Another company with a good shot of being worth over $1 trillion soon is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Think about that list for a moment. There's no car maker on it. No big manufacturer like General Electric (NYSE:GE). There's no oil company, no mining company, no steel company, and no banking company.The market has spoken. Technology -- with its ability to create smartphones, software, time-saving apps, social media platforms, online shopping experiences, and the like -- is now the most dominant, most valued part of our economy. Tech entrepreneurs and investors are making fortunes as a result.If Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are the tallest skyscrapers -- the commanding heights of our &quot;economic city&quot; -- it's no exaggeration to say their foundations rest on the bedrock of our communications grid … aka &quot;the internet.&quot; Without this bedrock, those skyscrapers crash to the ground.As you read this, the next trillion-dollar companies -- the next Amazon, the next Alphabet, etc. -- are being hatched in research facilities and garages around the world. These firms will change the world and revolutionize our economy. If you follow technology the least little bit, you know what fields these companies are in: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, virtual reality/augmented reality, blockchain, mobile payments, and the Internet of Things (IoT).Just like how the businesses of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft can't function without the internet, the next generation of world-changing, $1 trillion mega winners can't survive without the subject of this essay. It's the bedrock our future will rest on … and it's a giant investment opportunity.Let me tell you more about it today. Then, be on the lookout for more research from me over the next week as we begin a special series looking at seven transformative trends changing our world that have the potential to double, triple, or even multiply your money 10X. How Building Toll Roads Can Make You a MillionaireOne way to view the internet buildout of the 1990s is as the construction of a vast network of toll roads.These toll roads linked friend to friend … family member to family member … and most importantly from a capitalist's point of view: business to consumer. Millions upon millions of people wanted to send their messages, data, and advertisements over the internet's toll roads. It was a communications revolution.History shows building the revolution's toll roads was incredibly profitable. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), the leading maker of networking equipment, enjoyed a 34,000% increase in market value during the 1990s. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which made computer chips, saw its stock soar more than 3,500% during the 1990s. EMC, which made data storage devices, saw its shares advance more than 80,000% during the 1990s.As incredible as the internet's first toll roads were, their size and capacity pales in comparison to the next generation of toll roads … which will lead to your doorstep soon.They go by the name of &quot;5G.&quot; You Ain't Seen Nothing YetThe path to the 5G wireless communications network began 45 years ago on Tuesday, April 3, 1973.Martin Cooper, a senior engineer at Motorola, stood on 6th Ave. in Manhattan. He was about to make the first cell phone call in history, and he was nervous about whether it would work.Martin didn't call a family member, friend or even a co-worker. Instead, he called his chief competitor, Dr. Joel Engle at Bell Labs. The two had been in a race to get to this day first.&quot;Joel, this is Marty,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm calling you from a cell phone, a real handheld personal cell phone.&quot;Consider those the first words in the mobile communications revolution.Mobile phones were then introduced to the public nearly a decade later, and by the 1980s, cell phones were creeping into the cars of wealthier individuals. The first devices weighed a couple of pounds and were bigger than your head -- they are referred to as &quot;bricks&quot; for a reason -- but they did what had never been done before. The first generation of mobile technology kicked off the trend toward an increasingly connected world.The second generation of networks (2G and 2.5G) were introduced in the 1990s. They gave us the ability to text, another step forward in communication. We now take texting for granted -- a lot of people text more than they make actual phone calls.The move into the new millennium was accompanied by the move to 3G, which brought major advances in the speed and capabilities of cellular networks. With the third generation, devices were able to access broadband technology, which made possible entertainment, web browsing, and shopping on a mobile device. There is now a generation of people who find it hard to believe that 20 years ago there was no Amazon app to instantly reorder your toilet paper.Just as semiconductors were part of the infrastructure for the internet, they were also the backbone of the move to 3G. As a result, chip stocks made big moves during this era. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rallied more than 1,000% in the 1990s ahead of when 4G networks started to appear.As nice as it was to be able to browse the internet on your phone, the fourth generation of wireless connectivity took mobile technology to another level with the ability to stream video without waiting for buffering. It was more enjoyable, yes, but it also opened up business opportunities for content companies.Still, the biggest advancement was real-time information, which led to the sharing economy. Mobile devices could talk to other devices in real-time, connecting people instantaneously. Without real-time data transfer there would be no Uber, GrubHub, or any other app that relies on a fast connection.Once again, there were big investment returns in the 4G phase. Cell tower companies were among those enjoying huge rallies. As more data was being transmitted with the increasing use of video, new and better towers were required.But honestly, we haven't seen anything yet. The most advanced breakthrough of all is right around the corner. Just as there were fortunes made in prior generations, there will be big money made once again. In fact, I think the opportunity is even bigger now because the leap ahead will drive some of the most powerful tech trends the world has seen.I think of it as the next-generation toll road. The road to the future passes through 5G, and it's time to set up our booth and start collecting. 5G's Widespread ImpactThe next-generation network will take speeds to levels that seem almost unimaginable.How fast?Well, 5G will in theory increase the level of speed to match that of human reflexes, so we're talking the blink of an eye, perhaps literally.The 4G network clocks in at around 100 megabits per second, which is extremely fast compared to 3G. But once 5G rolls out, that number jumps to 10,000 megabits per second -- or 100 times faster than the current speed.Why do we need the speed to be 100 times faster? It will eliminate those slow connections we run into at times, which is nice, but what's really about to happen is that phones and mobile devices are about to become mobile supercomputers.The big breakthrough will be the ability to connect a lot more devices that share large amounts of data in real-time. So if you think we live in a connected world already, get ready.From cloud storage to the Internet of Things to augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), 5G will allow all of the most dominant tech trends of our time to not only flourish but reach new heights. 5G and the Future of TransportationThere is one breakthrough industry in particular that cannot exist without 5G: autonomous vehicles, or AVs.Just as investors who were able to get in early during prior transformational trends profited to the tune of 20 to 50 times their money, the AV/5G mega-trend is one current transformational trend that cannot be ignored.When a $7 trillion industry like transportation is completely transformed for the first time in nearly a century, it will have huge ramifications. The full rollout of the 5G network will provide the much-needed communications infrastructure for auto manufacturers to introduce AVs to the masses. It's reliability and real-time data sharing that make that possible.Imagine a self-driving car traveling down the highway at 75 miles per hour and the network suddenly experiences a 100-millisecond delay. In any other circumstance, that delay would never be noticed, but it could be devastating in an AV. It could result in the braking system stopping the vehicle 10 feet beyond where it would have otherwise. That 10 extra feet could lead to a major accident.Future AVs will essentially be data centers on wheels. The amount of data that will be stored in the brain of the vehicle will be beyond what we can imagine.Morgan Stanley predicts that a 2050 AV will produce 40 terabytes (TBs) of data per hour. Today, your iPhone produces data in the range of 1-2 gigabytes (GBs) per month. That would mean a 2050 AV will produce about 20,000 times more data in one hour than your iPhone currently produces in an entire month!Such enormous amounts of data will be required due to the number of decisions taking place at all times. The AV will have to take in data from sensors surrounding the vehicle and instantaneously decide when to accelerate, brake, turn, etc. Not only will the vehicle need 5G for computing within itself, it will also be talking to the sensors in other vehicles, the roads, cell towers, satellites, and even smart cities.The thought of vehicles &quot;talking&quot; to each other makes me think of some pretty creepy sci-fi images. It also makes me think of the movie Cars.In reality, vehicles talking to each other will look nothing like the animated movie but more like the image below. Notice that everything has a sensor that is talking to the other sensors in the area. Even the man pushing the child in the stroller and the bicyclist are talking to the vehicles!This stuff is coming. Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) has plans to deploy its vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology in the U.S. by 2021. Again, the rollout of V2V and V2I is impossible without widespread 5G. The current 4G network is great for streaming videos, but the speed and latency would create major safety issues for AVs. Get in Position NowYou can see how 5G networks will pave the way for so many breakthrough innovations, not just faster phones but in self-driving cars, smart homes and cities, virtual reality, healthcare, and so much more.When exactly does all of this excitement happen?It's already starting.You may have seen advertising for 5G home internet service in limited cities. Smartphone manufacturers are already rolling out the first 5G-enabled phones.The pace will only pick up from here. That's true of the stock prices, too, which will move ahead of specific developments.Long-term winners in this sector will be 5G gear makers like Nokia (NYSE:NOK), 5G infrastructure providers like Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI), and specialized chip makers like Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS).Consider that short list a jumping off point for 5G ideas, but by no means a complete or static guide. The early days of any technological revolution are full of change. My advice is to follow this sector closely, study it frequently for emerging winners, and own a handful of companies to get a good blend of risk/reward.You'll end up owning some of the world's most valuable toll roads … just like the smartest investors of the 1990s did.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

Put simply, today was the worst day of 2019 for U.S. stocks.The Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.81% while the S&P 500 shed 3.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 3.23% as trade fears held investors hostage for another day.Before getting into the bloodbath, allow me to point out a not-so-fun fact. I have been penning the &quot;Dow Jones Today&quot; wrap up since late May. Regular readers know that I frequently point out something along the lines of &quot;20 of the Dow's stocks closed up/down today.&quot; Today was a first because, in late trading, all 30 Dow components were in the red and in most cases, deeply so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is how bad things were for the Dow today: the index's two best performers last week were Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and those stocks lost 0.67% and 1.32% respectively, today.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long &quot;Of course, Coke generates a lot of revenue overseas--about 46% of its total sales--but no one expects people to stop drinking Coke (or the company's other beverages),&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Verizon and Coke stocks yield 4.3% and 3.1%, respectively, better than the 2.3% average yield for stocks in the Dow.&quot; Trade Problems Equal Dow Tech WoesOn days like today, it is accurate to use the word &quot;unfortunate&quot; to describe the Dow's construction. Unfortunate because the index features no exposure to the real estate and utilities sectors, groups that are not export-dependent and that generate nearly all of their revenue in the U.S.The Dow is, however, heavily exposed to some cyclical sectors that are big exporters and vulnerable to trade wars, such as technology. Led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which slipped 5.23%, all six of the Dow's tech components finished lower today. Underscoring how bad today was for tech stocks, the best-performing tech name in the Dow today was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), shares of which tumbled 3.51%.With Apple being a bellwether stock, there was some analyst support out today for the iPhone maker.&quot;We believe Apple is more likely to absorb all the tariff impact and not raise prices on iPhone shipments and other hardware devices into the US, which we estimate will lead to a ~300 bps headwind to iPhone margins,&quot; said JPMorgan. Oil Stocks in the Dow Run DryWest Texas Intermediate futures slid almost 2% today, which was about the average loss for Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Oil and energy stocks are considered riskier assets and not suitable for days like today. More pressing (or depressing) for oil is the emergence of electric vehicles and alternative energy.In a note out today, Mark Lewis, global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas, said &quot;the economics of renewables in tandem with EVs are set to become irresistible over the next decade.&quot; Dow Technical ConcernsYes, we're on the slower end of earnings season, but Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports tomorrow. That report could be taking on added significance because Disney stock closed below its 50-day moving average today for the first time since April.That's potentially bad news for multiple reasons, not the least of which is the fact that Disney stock has traded lower after six of the company's last eight earnings reports. Bottom Line on DJIAWhen I'm not writing the Dow Jones Today, I'm usually writing about ETFs, so I'm going to use that asset class to highlight what worked today and what should work if these trade tensions continue plaguing stocks.There are over 2,200 ETFs trading in New York, of which fewer than 400 closed higher today. Strip out the leveraged and inverse products, and that number declines considerably. What worked in terms of &quot;normal&quot; ETFs today were gold and other precious metals funds and bonds including treasuries (not surprising), corporate debt, municipal bonds, and some international sovereigns.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Here are five that look like they're heading for trouble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are threatening to fall back below their 200-day moving average in what would likely presage a drop back to its January-March trading range. Such a move would be worth a loss of roughly 10% from here. It also marks a scary looking double-top pattern that connects to the high set last September near the $2,000 level.The large-cap stock will next report results on October 24 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $4.75 per share on revenues of $68.7 billion. When the company last reported on July 25, earnings of $5.22 missed estimates by 41 cents on a 19.9% rise in revenues. Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are breaking down below their 50-day moving average, breaking down away from a triple-top resistance pattern going back to October associated with a series of lower highs. While hype is building for the release of refreshed iPhone handsets later this year, the company is vulnerable not only to a backlash against American consumers in China but import tariffs on its products coming into the United States from its suppliers in China.  * 8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income The large-cap stock -- often the largest cap stock -- will next report results on October 31 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.83 per share on revenues of $62.7 billion. When the company last reported on July 30, earnings of $2.18 per share beat estimates by eight cents on a 1% rise in in revenues. General Electric (GE)Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) are falling away from a tight seven-month consolidation range and look set for a violation of their 200-day moving average. The company, which remains in turnaround mode, has seen its shares lose roughly two-thirds of their value since late 2016 as management changes have given way to doubts about what the future holds.The company will next report results on October 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 14 cents per share on revenues of $29.2 billion. When the company last reported on July 31, earnings of 17 cents per share beat estimates by five cents on a 1.1% decline in revenues. Alibaba (BABA)Shares of Chinese internet retail giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are collapsing below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, threatening to fall down to test its June lows. An extension would result in a decline back to its January low for a loss of more than 16% from here. This caps a long sideways range going back to late 2017 when the U.S.-China trade war first started to heat up.  * 7 Biotech ETFs That Should Remain Healthy The company will next report results on August 15 before the bell.

This caps a sideways consolidation range going back to early 2018 and sets the stage for a test of the late December lows near $230 -- a move that would be worth a loss of roughly 30% from here.The company will next report results on October 15 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.05 per share on revenues of $5.3 billion.

85,0.9889,"Since its second-quarter earnings miss, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has fallen over 10% in a perfect storm of bad publicity.Shares that traded at almost $2,000 each before the second quarter numbers came out opened Aug. 5 below $1,800 and are expected to fall further.Earnings of $2.625 billion, $5.22 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $63.4 billion, were below Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 per share. Revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS) also came in $120 million light, at $8.38 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long The stock fell despite the fact total revenue was up 20% year-over-year, up from 16% in the first quarter. Operating cash flow of $9.1 billion, which Amazon considers its key metric, was up 22% from $7.4 billion a year earlier. AMZN Stock's Perfect StormThe last month was highlighted by a full-throated Trump Administration attack on the company.The Federal Trade Commission is investigating last year's agreement to directly sell Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, over its impact on re-sellers. The Administration is also looking to halt the Pentagon's move to build its own Amazon cloud, matching one the CIA bought years ago.AWS is being blamed for the hack of Capital One (NYSE:COF), even though it was a Capital One firewall that broke.CEO and co-founder Jeff Bezos added to the post-earnings selling pressure, dumping $1.8 billion of stock after the numbers came out. It was his first big sale since October, and his largest to date. Bezos has said he needs $1 billion per year to fund his Blue Origin rocket venture. He and his ex-wife have pledged $2 billion to help homeless families and create pre-schools.When bad news hits, of course, other news piles in. The head of Amazon's studio is taking a sabbatical. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is launching an Amazon-like membership plan called CarePass. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is suing over an alleged plot to steal high-volume sellers off its platform. Amazon Stock's Perfect OpportunityBut Amazon isn't slowing down. If anything, it's accelerating.It's planning another run at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in fresh food. That &quot;disappointing&quot; cloud quarter masks a 33% market share that's holding steady against growing competition. The company is looking to buy a stake in India's largest brick-and-mortar retailer.Amazon's streaming service is broadening its offerings, with plenty of cash to take on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), along with a $10 per month price that, with free shipping, looks free.Amazon is looking to cut down on packaging waste and is finally ready to start delivering packages with drones. It has also launched one-day shipping.Amazon also has defenses against Trump criticism. Contrary to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's charge that it has &quot;destroyed retail,&quot; over half of what Amazon sells comes from third parties, mostly small businesses. Despite its large size Amazon still represents less than 5% of the retail market. The Bottom Line on AMZN StockAmazon stock is not for everyone.If you need your investments to pay you in cash, Amazon has no dividend and is very unlikely to add one any time soon.But of 55 analysts following the stock none has a sell rating on it. The last holdout, Allen Gillespie of FinTrust, finally moved into the &quot;hold&quot; camp last week.Amazon only dominates in e-commerce where, as previously noted, over half the revenue is on behalf of third parties. It has one-third of the cloud market, a small piece of entertainment, and rivals like UPS (NYSE:UPS) are both spending big and profiting from that investment.Amazon stock remains the best long-term holding out there. If you have a long-term investment horizon and don't own any let the market panic, then look for an entry point.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

He explains why international investing demands a top-down macro view to focus on geographies, married to a bottom-up approach when selecting individual stocks from within those regions. India has become his single biggest portfolio holding. After spending 20 years as a bear on Russia equities, he said he recently turned bullish. Jain also explains why international corporate bonds are a great tell for related equities.

The shares have lost almost 9% over a three-day slump.In the latest development of the trade war, China let the yuan tumble to the weakest level in more than a decade and asked state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products. Wall Street analysts described the retaliation as “massive,” calling it an “11” on a scale of one to ten.Apple has been particularly vulnerable to the trade tensions. Not only does it rely on China for key components of its supply chain, but nearly 20% of Apple’s 2018 revenue came from the country, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Apple’s sales in China may come under greater pressure” after the latest development, wrote John Butler, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.

117,0.4764,"Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock reports its earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 7 after the closing bell. In recent quarters, Roku has become one of the highlights of earnings season due to the extreme reactions the stock tends to bring.However, this also means traders might have to redefine &quot;disappointment&quot; for Roku stock. With an equity prone to huge moves after earnings, it is the lack of a reaction that would hurt traders more than an extreme drop.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long  A Likely Earnings Beat and Reaction in ROKU StockWall Street foresees a consensus 21 cents per share loss in Roku's second quarter. The company broke even in the same quarter last year. They also predict revenues of $224.2 million. That would represent a 43% increase from the second quarter of 2018 when the company brought in $156.81 million.Traders can (almost) count on two things when the company reports earnings. For one, Roku stock has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates in every report since its September 2017 IPO. I would not expect that to change this time.Moreover, ROKU almost always reacts strongly to these reports. The previous report led to a 28.1% one-day increase in the stock price. In February, the Roku stock price rose by 25.2% after earnings. November's third-quarter report brought a 22.3% drop in the stock. Those reactions will not go on forever. Still, it should not surprise traders to see another 20%-plus change in the stock price. Where Will ROKU Stock Go?I would not necessarily count on a higher move in the short term. Our own Nicolas Chahine described Roku stock as &quot;over the top and headed higher.&quot; I agree with that in the long-term.Roku continues to maintain its lead over competitors. In the market share for streaming, Roku stock `remains well ahead of Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the second and third-leading streaming platforms respectively.Also, given the stock's reaction to earnings in the last two quarters, I cannot discount the possibility of yet another spike higher following earnings.However, InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley's warning that investors should take profits could also prove correct. For one, ROKU trades at about 14 times sales and more than 30 times its book value. Yes, equities such as Roku stock can defy gravity for years. However, the overall market has suffered in recent trading sessions, so traders should not rule out the possibility of a massive selloff.Investors should note that it once held an advantage over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) as a neutral platform. Due to the launch of the Roku channel, that neutrality has ended. Admittedly, it has thrived by launching an advertising and streaming ecosystem. However, it remains unclear whether abandoning its neutrality will help the company. Should I Buy ROKU Stock Before Earnings?When asking whether to buy or to sell Roku stock before earnings, I would say no, except as a speculative position on both sides. What I mean by that is, ROKU is one of the few stocks where one might profit from a straddle, or buying both a call and a put option. For most equities, the cost of options right before earnings is such that most traders will lose money on such a trading strategy.The Roku stock price stands at just over $100 per share as of the time of this writing. A call option with a $100 strike price expiring on Aug. 9 (just after earnings) sells for $8.90. An equivalent put option trades at $8.17. This means that the stock will have to move more than 17% (not including fees) for a straddle bet to earn a profit.I still see that as a risky gambit much too expensive to recommend. However, investors should note that most of the one-day moves following earnings have exceeded 17%.In the long run, I see Roku stock as an equity headed much higher. However, given the overall market conditions, I foresee pain in the near term, and I would not buy at this time.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

120,-0.7783,"U.S. stock futures are plunging this morning as the latest turn in the trade war pushed into the currency markets. In response to the new tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by President Trump's last week, China allowed its currency, the yuan, to tumble to its lowest reading in more than a decade.Source: Shutterstock Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 1.38%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 1.55%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 2.11%.In the options pits, put volume rocketed to extreme levels, revealing continued panic in the face of the trade war escalation. Calls were hot as well but to a lesser extent. By day's end, some 22.1 million calls and 25.8 million puts changed hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe groundswell in put demand made a massive impact at the CBOE, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rallying to 0.87. That marks a new 2019 high and suggests capitulation is nigh. Given the bloodbath expected this morning, we could see even higher readings before a bottom is found, however. As for the 10-day moving average, it climbed to 0.69.Options traders swarmed tech stocks on Friday. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) all saw heavy options trading.Let's take a closer look: Apple (AAPL)The reversal of fortune in Apple after its earnings party has been unfortunate. The earnings numbers were good, but market-moving events like the Federal Reserve meeting and, more importantly, the latest turn in the Trade War have conspired to steal all earnings-related gains.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever With the weekend currency drama, AAPL stock is set to open down just shy of 3% to $198. That will land it at the rising 50-day moving average and provide traders with a good shot at a bounce. Here's an important reminder, however. As the market correction persists, correlations will run hot. Individual stocks will trade less on their underlying fundamentals and more on whatever the latest headline is. Absent a snapback in the broader market, AAPL will probably struggle to find its footing.On the options trading front, puts slightly outpaced calls on Friday. Total activity popped to 194% of the average daily volume, with 824,113 contracts traded. Puts accounted for 55% of the day's take.Implied volatility pushed higher to 30% placing it at the 37th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $3.83 or 1.9%. Amazon (AMZN)Amazon fell for the seventh day in a row on Friday and is now down 10% from its 2019 peak reached last month. This morning's ugliness is chopping another 2.6% off its price tag and will push the e-commerce giant deeper into oversold territory.Volume patterns are showing three consecutive distribution days ushering AMZN stock into the weekend. With institutions leaning on the sell button, it has been challenging to find a bottom. No doubt this morning's whack will bring us closer to the level of bloodletting needed for a tradable bounce to form.On the options trading front, the patterns mirrored that of Apple with puts leading the way. Activity swelled to 190% of the average daily volume, with 339,320 total contracts traded. Puts claimed 56% of the session's sum.Implied volatility has been rising during the slide, but given its extremely low starting point, it still sits in the lower end of its range. At 29%, it sits at the 21st percentile of the one-year range. That number will certainly rise this morning though. The daily expected moves are now $32.77 or 1.8%. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter may be the most impressive stock of the technology sector. It has completely sidestepped the broad market weakness, powered higher by its recent earnings release. The weekend drama is weighing it down but don't be surprised if the bearishness is short-lived. TWTR stock is set to open down 2.80%, near $41.65.Even if we see downside follow-through, multiple support zones will come into play that should bring buyers to the yard.  * 7 Big Dividend Stocks to Consider In a Low-Rate World On the options trading front, puts traded heavy despite Friday's strength. Activity jumped to 150% of the average daily volume, with 151,622 total contracts traded; 72% of the trading came from put options alone.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 40%, placing it at the 20th percentile of its one-year range.

121,0.9997,"[Editor's Note: &quot;The 9 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade&quot; was originally published in April 2017. Each stock pick has been updated to reflect changes in the market.]A few years ago, InvestorPlace contributor Dan Burrows highlighted the ten best-performing S&P 500 stocks of the past decade. The most important lesson one finds by studying these high-flying stocks is that patience wins out over all other attributes of a successful investor.A classic example of how true this is involves the Fidelity Magellan Fund (MUTF:FMAGX), the large mutual fund made famous by portfolio manager Peter Lynch. Lynch ran the fund for 13 years from 1977 until 1990, growing it from $20 million to $14 billion before stepping aside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFidelity studied the returns of Fidelity Magellan unit holders over those 13 years to see how they compared to the legendary portfolio manager. While Lynch managed to achieve a 29% annual return over this period, the average investor lost money.Patience would have served those investors well, as the ups and downs of the stock market shook them out of their positions -- and in doing so, deprived them of millions of dollars in profits. A $10,000 investment in 1977 held until 1990 was worth $273,947 by the end of that 13-year period.I'm not Peter Lynch, but I can say with some confidence that the following names are the nine best stocks to buy for the next decade.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Let's take a look. Amazon (AMZN)Not only is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos a great chief executive, but Amazon has its hands in so many pies -- including a very profitable cloud business that generated $7.3 billion of operating income last year -- that it's hard to fathom just how big Amazon could be a decade from now.While Amazon's AWS cloud business is a big deal, Amazon Prime is the service that delivers the goods when it comes to building the foundation for AMZN stock. More than 100 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime at $119 per year.It's not the billions of dollars of annual subscription revenue that matters, but the amount each of those subscribers spends on other Amazon products. Statistics show that 76% of Amazon Prime members spend more than they did before paying the annual $119 fee.That's what you call &quot;pulling power,&quot; and it's a big reason why AMZN stock will be a winner for the long haul and why it's a top stock to buy for the next decade. Apple (AAPL)You can say what you want about the iPhone maker's best days being behind it, but I have a feeling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will continue to create products people want to buy for years to come.What these products are, I couldn't tell you … What I do know is that Apple will continue to generate a huge amount of free cash flow to reward shareholders for their patience and loyalty.That loyalty translated into AAPL stock becoming the world's first publicly traded company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long While Apple is no longer reporting iPhone numbers, its Services revenue continues to look more and more promising. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Warren Buffett is 89 years old. Eventually, he's going to step out of the game. The argument is that his departure will create a panic that will send Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) stock spiraling downward. Personally, I don't subscribe to that theory.Businesses -- whether it be a huge holding company like Buffett's or something much less grandiose -- are valued by calculating the present value of its future cash flows. Berkshire Hathaway's are significant. Another way is to value a business is to look at the sum of all its parts.Berkshire Hathaway owns hundreds of businesses; each of these firms, if sold at auction, would be worth more than the current stock price would seem to reflect. If Buffett moved on and the company was broken up in a prudent manner over an extended period, Berkshire Hathaway investors would benefit greatly from such a process.The best part of Berkshire Hathaway? You get a quasi-mutual fund with a diversified group of holdings and no management fees.That's the best kind of buy-and-hold investment. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)The retail industry is in a freefall at the moment, yet Illinois-based Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is busy growing its network of stores -- which currently number over 1,100 -- by 100 per year. It expects to build out its brick-and-mortar footprint to 1,700 stores over the next decade.Ulta's business model provides a shopping experience that is unique in a beauty market where no one firm controls a big chunk of market share, not even Sephora.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long With consumer confidence growing, Ulta stands a good chance over the next decade of bumping this number significantly higher. ULTA shares might be expensive at nearly 30 times earnings, but that's the price you pay to own the best. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Ulta Beauty helps women with their beauty needs; Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW) does the same for houses and businesses around the world.What's the one thing real estate professionals suggest you should do when selling your home? Give it a fresh coat of paint. It's the most cost-effective improvement you can make to bring in better offers.Sherwin-Williams originally tried to buy Mexican paint company Comex in 2014, but it was beaten out by PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG). More than two years later, it bought The Valspar Corp, significantly improving its position in the coatings business outside North America.Over the past decade, SHW has achieved a return of around 800%, significantly greater than the S&P 500's 190% climb in that same period.If any stock can repeat this kind of performance over the next decade, Sherwin-Williams has to be at the top of the list. Kraft Heinz (KHC)In 2017, the management of Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) put quite the scare into the 169,000 Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE:UL) employees with a potential $143 billion offer to buy the company. Fortunately (for employees), Unilever's management told  3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which control KHC, to take a hike.Kraft Heinz is going to make another acquisition. And when it does, the first thing 3G is going to do is trim the fat. (Read this article about Tim Hortons to understand their cost-cutting ruthlessness.) That's going to mean the loss of a lot of jobs.While that's terrible for the people on the receiving end of the pink slips, it's been proven by 3G Capital time and again to significantly increase the bottom line. Shareholders definitely will win as Kraft Heinz guts PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) or some other vulnerable target.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Kraft Heinz stock did take a big hit in February after the company took a huge impairment charge and revealed that the SEC has been probing its accounting practices. KHC also cut its dividend by 36% that month. But the company has more than enough cash to cover its dividend, and its products will continue to sell well because people always need to eat, while its offerings remain very popular in the U.S. Moreover, KHC stock still has an impressive 5% dividend yield. Five Below (FIVE)In an age where you have retailers going out of business left and right, Jim Cramer is right to rave about teen discount clothing chain Five Below Inc (NASDAQ:FIVE).In today's retail, you either want to be in the discount or luxury businesses, but not in the deadly middle. Five Below has a plan to grow revenues and earnings by 28% every year for the next five years. In 2019, revenues and earnings are expected to grow 22% and 48.6%, respectively, to $1.56 billion and $2.66 per share.Five Below expects to continue opening new stores, reaching 2,000 stores open in the U.S. at some point in the future. While it seems like an ambitious goal given how many stores are closing these days, Five Below has a very talented management team led by CEO Joel Anderson, whose previous job was CEO of Walmart.com (NYSE:WMT).At prices $5 or below, Five Below delivers a concept that's unique to teen and pre-teen customers. And it should deliver plenty of returns over the next 10 years. Cracker Barrel (CBRL)Over the past decade, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) has more than doubled the performance of the S&P 500 by delivering consistent results. Its return on equity is an impressive 34%.CBRL's unique restaurant/retail concept generates approximately 80% of its revenue from its restaurants, with its retail shop the remaining 20%. The average store throws off revenue of $4.6 million. The retail business generates sales per square foot of $440 and 50% gross margins.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Cracker Barrel features a strong female presence in upper management, representing what a modern progressive American company is supposed to look like at the top. Good on them … and good for you, because that kind of diversity will pay off in spades. ResMed (RMD)Who knew that sleep apnea paid so well?ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) manufactures medical devices and provides cloud-based software applications for medical professionals to treat and manage sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Treating 2 million patients daily, ResMed has become good at reducing healthcare costs by minimizing the effects of chronic disease.Good businesses make and save people and companies money. ResMed does both.Over the past decade, ResMed has delivered an annual return to shareholders of around 17%, much greater than the S&P 500.According to a study, 26% of adults have sleep apnea -- a disorder that can wreak havoc on a person's heart, not to mention a marriage due to both partners' lack of sleep. My dad died as a result of COPD, a disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide and costs the healthcare system more than $50 billion per year in the U.S. alone.ResMed has growth opportunities in Latin America, Eastern Europe and China and India -- all huge markets that will keep it busy for the next decade and beyond.Of all the stocks to buy for the next decade, ResMed is my pick for most reliable given the markets it serves.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

129,0.9916,"Many Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholders likely don't even realize the company is in the set-top streaming video receiver business. Certainly, Nvidia stock isn't broadly considered a set-top play.Source: Shutterstock Many people are correctly certain that Nvidia isn't making a meaningful dent in the market share enjoyed first and foremost by Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and then Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and then Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Yet, Nvidia is indeed a player in the set-top streaming video receiver business, taking aim at the higher-end of the market while most other names in the business are value-minded. The Nvidia Shield TV media player retails at between $179 and $199, depending on the version being considered.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now It's hardly a game-changer for the company. Indeed, not only is Nvidia rarely even listed on the regular market share reports that say Roku is leading the streaming hardware race, Shield TV isn't even mentioned with Nvidia's quarterly updates. Nor should it be, yet.If the goal of bothering with the minuscule venture is to plant seeds and see what happens though, the company's television-centric ambitions are laying some very interesting groundwork. Shield TV and Nvidia StockIt's a curious platform. Shield is Android-powered and functions like any other Android device. Just a few days ago its operating system began upgrades to Android 9 Pie giving users the most up-to-date functionality any user can experience with Android apps. That includes Chromecast apps, which work just fine in the typical Android environment.It's not just a streaming piece of hardware though. It's a robust computing tool in and of itself. The latest versions run on Nvidia's Tegra X1 processor (the same processor used by the Nintendo Switch), utilizing eight-core ARM tech and three gigabytes of RAM to deliver 4K UHD (2160p) pictures.It seems like overkill for a market that's mostly made up of consumers who just want a casual experience. Why bother at all just to price itself out of the market?And, such an assessment from NVDA shareholders would hold water, if the goal were simply to serve as the intermediary between content and viewer.It's possible, however, Nvidia may have something more in mind with its Shield TV than merely acting as a video-streaming platform. Shield TV Has PotentialWhat that plan may remain in question, perhaps even to Nvidia itself. But, should the purpose become crystal clear at a later date, the company is ready.We may have already seen a glimpse of that future purpose, in fact.It's not ground-breaking news to point out that the world of video gaming is changing.It began with digital downloads displacing cartridge and disc-based games but has continued on to begin the displacement of consoles as game-playing devices themselves. Indie hit Fortnite, initially needing a PC to play, has since become playable on a smartphone.Even Nvidia is making graphics-processing hardware intended to offload to the cloud the heavy-duty computing needed to play top games. It means game-streaming services like Stadia, now in development by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), can be played on even a low-quality machine.It's been rumored, in fact, that Nvidia is specifically developing support to power Google's Stadia games played on Shield TV devices.The prospect isn't a stretch. Shield TV devices can already be purchased with a gamepad, for the purpose of playing Android-based games. Cloud-based game streaming outside of Android's ecosystem is increasingly common as well. It's the shape of things to come. Shield TV and Nvidia Stock DownsidesIt's difficult to call Nvidia's Shield TV a game console, of course, but it's also difficult to say it's not one. That's a good reason for concern.Consumers have seen such hybrids fail before. The Android-powered Ouya was released in 2012 to a lukewarm and mostly confused reception. The console and its back-end support finally shuttered for good earlier this year, having never found the sliver of the market that wants a decent game console and a streaming device in one, but is unwilling to spend the $400 or even $500 needed to purchase an Xbox or PlayStation.It may have been a device that materialized before its time though. Stadia and other cloud/streaming game platforms possibly could have kept the Ouya afloat if they were around seven years ago.It may have also been a device that lacked the big-name backing needed to inject such a device into a crowded space. Nvidia wouldn't face such a problem.And yet, gaming is still not necessarily all that Shield TV brings to the table. Bottom Line for Nvidia StockAgain, don't look for NVDA shares to be catapulted anytime soon by its subtle entry into muddied console/streaming-box waters. Nvidia doesn't seem to care all that much about the business and is instead focusing on more pressing opportunities like discreet GPUs and artificial intelligence. That's as it should be.Still, in that nobody truly knows how (or even if) consumers are going to be demanding a different kind of engagement when cloud-based gaming becomes the norm, this budding technology should be factored into the long-term outlook for Nvidia stock.NewZoo says gamers will spend nearly $140 billion on their pastime this year. Offering a high-powered, multi-purpose platform that can handle even the most intense games wouldn't be a bad way for Nvidia to capture a piece of that market.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But QCOM stock watchers called the company's guidance &quot;disappointing&quot; because it stripped out its business with China's Huawei from the results.The shares lost about $3 on the news and ended the week just above $71 after touching $76.25 on July 29. This pushes the yield on the 62 cent per share dividend to 3.48%. The 30-year U.S. government bond currently yields just 2.49%.The numbers, however, have little to do with Qualcomm's business and more to do with its status as a legal and political pinata.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm for AmericaAs I wrote on July 22, Qualcomm's legal claim linking patents to chip sales is now fully supported by the Trump administration, despite negative reaction from a court.Three agencies -- the Departments of Energy, Justice and Defense -- are now on the record arguing that legal action against the monopoly threatens national security.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels The decision by U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh, an Obama appointee, calling Qualcomm's &quot;no patent, no chips&quot; practice illegal, continues to be fought by the administration, with letters to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals asking for a stay of the decision.  Qualcomm for ChinaDespite administration rhetoric calling Qualcomm a bulwark against China's tech ambitions, Qualcomm continues to do business there. If anything, it's even more deeply involved with the world's second-biggest economy than ever before.Qualcomm recently signed a deal with Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) to collaborate on digital entertainment. This could result in the two companies jointly developing a mobile gaming device or smartphone. That's important as gaming shifts to online and mobile platforms, where Tencent is a clear leader.Qualcomm is also working with China to make 5G the standard communication system for self-driving cars. NXPI (NASDAQ:NXPI), which Qualcomm tried to buy last year, is behind a rival standard based on WiFi. A win for Qualcomm here could bring tens of billions of dollars in royalty payments down the road. The Legal DiscountHow well Qualcomm's doing depends a lot on whether you use GAAP or non-GAAP measurements.The former, which counts cash in escrow under legal dispute as income, shows the company earning $2.1 billion, or $1.75 per share of QCOM stock fully diluted, on revenue of $9.6 billion during the most recent quarter. Under non-GAAP accounting Qualcomm said it will earn just 65 cents-75 cents per share next quarter on $4.2-5.1 billion of revenue.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 In its latest report the company estimated it will get $4.7 billion from the settlement of its dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and those revenues are included in its GAAP calculations. Apple recently bought most of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) smartphone modem business for $1.2 billion, and plans to eventually replace Qualcomm modems with its own.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf also said his company has yet to reach a final agreement with Huawei, so its outlook doesn't include those payments. He said Chinese carriers won't start launching 5G services until next year, eliminating a normal seasonal earnings boost. He predicted they will start seeing the full benefits of 5G in the first quarter of 2020. Bottom Line on QCOM StockThe uncertainty over China and its legal status means QCOM stock continues to be range-bound. Many analysts don't know what to think. What presents as a tech stock is trading like a law firm.The result is a bargain for income-oriented investors. Qualcomm easily out-earns its dividend and continues to accumulate cash. It also has more than $14 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books, meaning 34% of its assets are liquid.

144,0.9942,"Goldman Sachs has just revealed a valuable investing strategy that’s worth keeping a close eye on in the coming months. The firm is now recommending stocks with the fastest expected return-on-equity growth (or ROE). That’s because market upside is increasingly limited from current lofty levels, says Goldman Sachs. Indeed, the S&P 500 has already put on a 17% sprint year-to-date- which means it is now trading very close to its fair value relative to interest rates, profitability and price-to-book valuations. As a result, investors must be particularly savvy when scouting for stocks with the potential to generate outsized returns. “We forecast flat S&P 500 margins through 2020, with risks tilted to the downside. ... Amid concerns about the growth and profitability outlook this year, investors have assigned a premium to companies able to expand ROE,” the firm’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin said. He directed investors to the firm’s basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest consensus estimates of ROE growth. This basket is already proving its worth and is currently beating the index by 5 percentage points year-to-date. In essence, ROE reflects the return a company generates on capital that is owned by the shareholders.“The basket typically outperforms in weakening growth environments as investors assign a scarcity premium to firms that are able to expand ROE despite index-level headwinds,” Kostin told investors. So with this outlook in mind, here are five stocks that feature on the firm’s ROE basket list:  1&#92;. Under Armour (UA)Athletic apparel retailer Under Armour has had a volatile time recently. Shares plunged 20% after the company reported disappointing revenue, on weaker-than-expected North American sales. Rising trade tensions haven’t helped either, although shares are still trading up 23% year-to-date.Don’t give up yet, says top Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jim Duffy. He has just reiterated his buy rating on the stock with a $30 price target (56% upside potential). He remains adamant that the bullish investing thesis ‘remains in-tact’ and advised investors to focus on UA’s ‘green pasture opportunities’ and ‘capacity for margin improvement and multi-year earnings power’. “Bears will cling to concerns over growth in North America… [but] we remain confident that Under Armour is building a healthier revenue base in North America, upon which it can grow more meaningfully in future periods, and continue to believe North America revenue can accelerate into 2020 and beyond,” Duffy wrote. Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez also focuses on the long-term picture: “With Under Armour in the early stages of its five-year plan, choppiness quarter-to-quarter is not unexpected,” he wrote. The analyst upgraded UA from Hold to Buy back in April, stating at the time “Under Armour has grown up, with a renewed focus on driving profitability and return on invested capital.” From the Street’s top analysts, UA shows a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus. That’s with 3 buy ratings vs 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $26 (35% upside potential).  2&#92;. Apple (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is another key stock highlighted by Goldman Sachs for its ROE potential. Investors rejoiced as Apple reported excellent 3Q:FY19 results and served up a strong outlook.  Although the iPhone portfolio continued to struggle in the quarter, Apple grew its non-iPhone revenue by 17% with notable strength in Wearables and further progress in Services. Following the quarter, five-star Monness analyst Brian White increased estimates, while raising his 12-month price target from $245 to $265 (30% upside potential). “We found the tone of the call upbeat with Apple serving up a strong outlook and voicing enthusiasm around the innovation pipeline” cheered White. He also noted that the launch of a 5G iPhone in 2020 has the potential to drive a healthy upgrade cycle.  Meanwhile Daniel Ives tells investors not to panic about President Trump’s latest tariff tweets. While AAPL remains the &quot;poster child&quot; for the US/China UFC trade battle, “seeing the forest through the trees the fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable in our opinion” Ives said. Best performing analysts score the stock a ‘Moderate Buy.’ In the last three months, AAPL has received 12 buy ratings and 8 hold ratings. These 20 top analysts have a $228 average analyst price target, indicating 12% upside potential for AAPL stock.  3&#92;. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Worldwide IT leader Cisco has just announced a $2.6 billion deal to buy high-speed optical components maker Acacia Communications. The acquisition should reinforce Cisco’s position as the leader in enterprise networking, enthuses five-star Robert W Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver. “With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic” explained Cisco’s executive VP, David Goeckeler. He added: &quot;The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers’ most demanding requirements.”However, as Ruykhaver points out, the deal will have to go through the standard regulatory process, which includes a Chinese review. He has a buy rating on the stock and $57 price target. Even though Emerging Markets (~20% of revenue) continues to be an area of inconsistency, the analyst believes Cisco remains very well positioned. That’s as the company makes important strides towards a recurring revenue model, which today account for 30% of the company’s revenue.Like Apple, Cisco shows a Moderate Buy consensus with 12% upside potential from the $60 average price target. Twelve top analysts have published buy ratings on the stock recently, with 5 analysts staying on the sidelines.  4&#92;. Sempra Energy (SRE)Serving approximately 40 million consumers worldwide, California-based Sempra Energy focuses on electric and natural gas infrastructure. RBC Capital’s Shelby Tucker has a buy rating on Sempra with a $145 price target. He made the bullish call despite the company’s recent earnings miss, noting that Sempra maintained its guidance for full year 2019.“The main driver of the miss to our estimate comes from weaker-than-expected results at SoCalGas and the Texas utilities, partially offset by stronger performance at Sempra LNG. Despite the miss, SRE has reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.70-$6.30” noted Tucker. Only a couple of analysts have published recent ratings on Sempra stock- with the consensus working out at Moderate Buy. Their average price target works out at $147 (8% upside potential).  5&#92;. Global Payments (GPN) Last but not least comes fintech giant Global Payments. The stock is buzzing right now following solid earnings results. Analysts responded with a wave of positive sentiment and price target hikes. Notably, SunTrust analyst Andrew Jeffrey raised his price target to $190.00 (from $175), while Susquehanna’s James Friedman now has a Street-high price target of $200.00 (up from $170 previously).“The quarter represents yet another beat-and-raise as Global Payments continues to deliver upside on both the top and bottom-line, and we view the updated FY19 targets as likely conservative based on our belief that there is margin upside for the [fiscal year] even beyond the upwardly revised margin outlook,” wrote Jefferies’ Trevor Williams, who rates the stock a buy with a $190 target price. “While the bar for the quarter was relatively high given the run in shares, we think that the results will be enough to sustain the momentum in the stock.” What’s more the massive $21.5 billion merger with Total System Services (TSS) is now fast-approaching. “Importantly, the TSS merger is set to close as early as the beginning of 4Q19 and preliminary work has led to mgmt. being incrementally more confident in delivering and potentially exceeding targets” commented Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane on July 31. Out of all the stocks highlighted by Goldman Sachs, GPN is the only stock with a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Indeed, 14 of 15 top analyst ratings in the last three months are a ‘buy.’ Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $180 suggests 11% upside potential lies ahead.

145,0.9582,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At some point in the next decade, a large, tractor-like device will start crawling the deepest seafloor, gathering potato-sized nuggets packed with metals crucial to electric vehicles, renewable-energy storage and smartphones. Nobody knows how badly this industrialization of the deep sea could damage the marine environment. Even proponents concede that it'll disrupt and permanently erase habitats that have been barely explored, much less understood.It's a bleak scenario and -- for now, at least -- it's on a fast track. In July, parties to an international organization chartered to oversee such mining moved closer to their goal of approving regulations by the end of 2020. Environmentalists and scientists have taken part in those discussions. But the companies that will use those minerals in their products -- electric-car makers such as Tesla Inc., battery makers such as Panasonic Corp., and consumer-technology companies such as Apple Inc. -- have remained silent. If the worst impacts from deep-sea mining are to be avoided, they need to speak up.The deep ocean, generally defined as waters at depths of 200 meters (656 feet) or more, accounts for 45% of the earth's surface and 95% of its habitable space. For centuries, humans believed that much of it was barren of life. But in recent decades exploration technology has advanced quickly, enabling scientists to identify approximately 250,000 species in the dark, cold depths. And that's just start: Researchers estimate there could be as many as 1.75 million more species yet to be discovered, along with 500 million different types of microorganisms.That biodiversity is threatened by an overweening global demand for metals and minerals. Last year, researchers in Germany warned of global cobalt shortages by 2050, spurred by increasing demand for energy storage in renewable-energy installations and electric vehicles. In May, a Tesla official told a gathering of miners, regulators and lawmakers that the company projects a looming shortage of copper, nickel and lithium -- all critical to making batteries and other car parts. Terrestrial resources are increasingly unattractive due to environmental, safety and cost concerns.The deep ocean would appear to offer an alternative. Current estimates are that just one section of seafloor -- the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that stretches from Hawaii to Baja -- contains more cobalt, manganese and nickel than all known terrestrial resources, as well as significant deposits of copper and other metals. In June, DeepGreen Metals Inc., a Canadian deep-sea mining startup, secured most of a $150 million package to facilitate feasibility studies in the area. Deep-sea mining, the company claims, will yield &quot;ethical, clean metals&quot; with &quot;no blasting, drilling, deforestation or impact on people.&quot;That's one way to look at it. The other is more troubling. DeepGreen aims to dig up trillions of metal-rich rocks known as polymetallic nodules. Formed over tens of millions of years, those rocks now support unique lifeforms and habitats on their surfaces. Once they’re gone, so are those organisms -- probably permanently.In 1989, researchers dragged a plough designed to mimic seafloor mining across a section of the CCZ, then returned over subsequent years to measure how quickly the habitats recovered. More than a quarter century later, during a 2015 survey, they found that &quot;diversity and community composition had not recovered.&quot; Researchers warned that the loss of nodules could cause changes that will last over &quot;geologic timescales&quot; and will impact food chains beyond the deep seafloor.Remarkably, that research represents the only long-term study ever done on the impact of deep-sea mining. Indeed, according to the U.S. government, over 80% of the seafloor remains &quot;unmapped, unobserved and unexplored.&quot; Proposed regulations being drafted by the International Seabed Authority, the global organization chartered by treaty to both protect and commercialize the seafloor, will require environmental impact statements before mining occurs, as well as careful observation during the mining. But, without long-term baseline studies, those impact statements will be more guesswork than science. This uncertainty poses serious ethical and reputational problems for the electric-car companies, battery manufacturers and other purveyors of “green” technology that hope to benefit from seafloor mining. How will Tesla's customers react if the company's battery supply chain is traced to the extinction of a photogenic species such as the adorable albino octopus, which lays its eggs on polymetallic nodules? Is Apple prepared to risk its hard-won green reputation if reports show its phone batteries have led to the collapse of fisheries dependent upon deep-sea life? It's worth recalling that a 2015 video of a straw in a turtle's nose spawned the global movement against disposable plastics that's now upending decisions at some of the world's largest petrochemical companies.Last year the European Parliament called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until the impact on marine environments, biodiversity and human activities at sea are better understood. It's a reasonable request that companies should embrace, if only as a means of ensuring that their reputations aren't damaged later.Firms could also demand better research, perhaps under the auspices of organizations such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative, a global consortium that helps some of the world's largest companies source metals and minerals using responsible standards. Only after miners and their customers understand the deep sea can they -- collectively -- decide what kind of biodiversity loss is worth a battery, windmill or a sleeker smartphone.(Corrects details of turtle video in ninth paragraph. )To contact the author of this story: Adam Minter at aminter@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nisid Hajari at nhajari@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

149,0.9942,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As a larger-than-life CEO, Warren Buffett tends to overshadow anything happening within his $500 billion conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Case in point: An entirely inconsequential charity lunch that’s been canceled between the billionaire and a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur has gotten far more attention than today’s quarterly earnings report from Berkshire will. It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that Berkshire Hathaway is the most valuable company in the world outside of the technology industry, an outlier in a ranking that goes like this: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Berkshire. Only five members of the S&P 500 index generate more free cash flow than Berkshire does. The company is run by 88-year-old Buffett and his 95-year-old business partner, Charlie Munger, who is just barely the oldest member of Berkshire’s aging board of directors. And though there are successors waiting in the wings, they simply won’t have the same prestige or credibility with shareholders. Even when one of the company’s other investment managers purchased a more than $800 million stake in Amazon.com Inc. earlier this year, investors wanted to hear about it from Buffett himself. There’s constant speculation about the future of Berkshire, including what giant companies Buffett may acquire next and whether it will be his final megadeal. The company is sitting on a record $122 billion of cash. But for now, let’s check in with the hodgepodge of businesses Berkshire already has, the health of which makes Buffett’s dealmaking possible. They earned a combined $6.14 billion in operating earnings in the latest period, down 11% from a year ago, as insurance underwriting income dropped. Berkshire’s insurance division is the most integral part of the conglomerate because Buffett can invest the premiums, earning a return before they get paid out to policyholders. In 2017, a surge in claims tied to natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey resulted in Berkshire’s worst underwriting loss in 15 years. The business is back to turning an underwriting profit, though the $353 million it took in last quarter is down a bit from the nearly $1 billion it earned a year ago. Still, the unit’s investment income climbed 20% to $1.37 billion. Gregg Warren, an analyst for Morningstar Inc., pegs the fair value of the entire insurance division at $149,900 a share. That makes up the largest portion of his $380,000 sum-of-the-parts estimate for Berkshire stock:One of Berkshire’s most well-known insurance brands is Geico, whose longtime CEO Tony Nicely retired a year ago. Buffett honored Nicely in his annual letter to shareholders in February, saying that his management created $50 billion of value for Berkshire. Part of the appeal of being a Berkshire company is that Buffett puts his trust in each subsidiary’s managers – like Nicely – and doesn’t meddle. At the same time, change can be good: Under Geico’s new leader, Bill Roberts, the insurer finally launched a phone app that tracks trips and promotes better driving, akin to the programs that Geico’s rivals have long used to boost profits.Across Berkshire, there are managers taking it upon themselves to implement positive changes and modernize the company, without threatening the cultural continuity Buffett would like to see. Some executives, including Mary Rhinehart, CEO of Johns Manville – a building-products maker owned by Berkshire – have begun a new tradition of regularly gathering to share strategies, even though Berkshire’s modus operandi has always been for its businesses to operate entirely independent of one another. “We’ve loved being part of Berkshire,” Rhinehart told me at Berkshire’s shareholder meeting in Omaha in May; it’s just that she saw an opportunity to take advantage of the network that the sprawling company has. That May meeting was a reminder that Berkshire is more than a cash machine that funds Buffett’s high-profile investments or a podium from which to share his views about markets and the economy. Dozens and dozens of individual companies make up Berkshire, each with its own unique brands and challenges. Take Dairy Queen: CEO Troy Bader explained to me how the ice cream chain is studying the rising popularity of dairy alternatives, trying to create “Instagrammable” menu items and looking at delivery for online orders. There’s also the interesting debate taking place around BNSF, Berkshire’s railroad, which has been slow to adopt precision railroading, a strategy that’s helping its competitors become more efficient. The railroad’s net earnings were $1.34 billion, a 2% boost from last year.In addition to Rhinehart’s and Bader’s businesses, Berkshire’s “manufacturing, service and retail” division comprises aerospace supplier Precision Castparts, chemical producer Lubrizol, McLane wholesale grocery distribution, Benjamin Moore paint, Fruit of the Loom underwear, NetJets private jets, See’s Candies, car dealerships, jewelry and furniture retailers and so on. Together they earned $2.49 billion in the quarter, which was unchanged from 2018.What drew Buffett to each of these very different businesses was the perceived durability of their brands and market share. How durable are they proving to be? That we don’t quite know because Berkshire doesn’t disclose many details about them in its filings.(2)It’s something I suspect will change once Buffett is no longer in charge. He wrote in this year’s letter that he doesn’t want Berkshire shareholders to “obsess on the details,” as that kind of analysis “can be mind-numbing” given the array of businesses Berkshire owns. But investors demand more transparency from CEOs who don’t have his celebrity and track record. I imagine that over time, folks like Greg Abel – Buffett’s likely successor who functions as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and also now broadly oversees all non-insurance operations – will conform to more public company traditions, such as hosting earnings calls and providing results on a more granular level.So often the greatest insight investors get into how Berkshire’s businesses may be doing is by studying the reports of other insurers, railroads and manufacturers. Perhaps that’s another reason so little attention is paid to Berkshire’s own Saturday earnings releases. But even though numerous large companies exist within the company, they are but small next to Buffett. (1) Slightly more is known about the inner-workings of Berkshire’s various electric utilities and other energy businesses because that division files its own reports and its debt isn’t guaranteed by the parent company.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

160,0.5724,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. plans to attach its name to Instagram and WhatsApp, branding them “Instagram from Facebook” and “WhatsApp from Facebook.”The move is controversial because both of the apps were born outside of Facebook, have very different corporate cultures and have thrived, in part, by having their own identities with consumers. Founders of the photo-sharing app and the messaging service left Facebook in 2018.“We want to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook,” a spokeswoman for the company said.The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook has monopoly powers. The regulatory body is looking into whether the social-media company acquired rivals to remove competitive threats and seek dominance in the industry.The changes in wording will appear in the apps’ log-in screens and in the Apple iOS and Google Play stores, for now, according to a Facebook spokeswoman. The Information earlier reported the rebranding. Facebook said in March they were testing the new names.To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.038,0.893,0.069,1

162,0.99,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing a deal Amazon.com Inc. made with Apple Inc. to sell iPhones directly on its e-commerce site, signaling the agency has increased oversight of the tech giant.John Bumstead, who sells refurbished Apple products, said in a Facebook post last month that about seven lawyers and an economist from the FTC interviewed him about the deal. He made the posting in a group of Apple resellers that complained about being forced to stop selling their refurbished products on Amazon.The FTC and the Justice Department are ramping up scrutiny of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. Facebook Inc. disclosed last week that the FTC is probing its businesses, the same week the Justice Department announced a broad review into whether tech companies are using their power to thwart competition.The FTC and Amazon declined to comment. Apple didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FTC inquiry was reported earlier by the Verge.Amazon announced last November that it would sell the most-recent iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Apple Watch and Apple TV models on its website, along with branded accessories and headphones from Apple’s Beats subsidiary. Previously, Amazon sold only older model iPhones.Amazon in 2015 stopped selling the Apple TV media-streaming device that wasn’t easily compatible with the e-commerce giant’s video service, an example of Amazon using its clout as the world’s biggest online retailer to promote products that helped push its own streaming content.In 2016, Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging that the online retailer was selling counterfeit Apple products on its web store.Bumstead has been complaining to the media that Amazon removed listings of refurbished Apple products from its site, pushing out small independent dealers of recycled devices.“Wouldn’t it be awesome if the FTC sued Apple/Amazon and actually SOLVED this problem for us?,” he posted on a Facebook page for Apple sellers.Marketplace ScrutinyLast week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin backed the Justice Department’s scrutiny of the technology sector and singled out the Seattle-based retailer. Amazon “destroyed the retail industry across the United States, so there’s no question they’ve limited competition,” Mnuchin said in a July 24 interview on CNBC. “There’s areas where they’ve really hurt small businesses.”Fears that Amazon may be shortchanging smaller merchants that sell on its marketplace have already drawn scrutiny from European antitrust officials and Congress.The European Commission opened a formal investigation earlier last month into Amazon’s dual role as retailer and online platform, focusing on the potential misuse of merchants’ data.Amazon’s agreements with marketplace sellers allow the company to collect “competitively sensitive information” on what’s selling and how much of a product merchants might have in stock, the EU said. The EU suspects that Amazon can spot best-selling products and start stocking the same items itself, promoting the most profitable or high-volume goods without having to take the risks that the other sellers did to find out what people buy.How Amazon treats its third-party sellers is also being scrutinized by the House Judiciary Committee as part of its separate probe into the technology industry. After a July 16 hearing before the House antitrust panel, Representative David Cicilline sent a letter to Amazon seeking information on its relationship with third parties that sell on its platform.The Rhode Island Democrat focused on testimony by Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton, who said that the company doesn’t use data it collects on sales to favor its own products over third-party sellers.The Justice Department is also investigating Alphabet Inc.’s Google and overseeing antitrust scrutiny of Apple, Bloomberg has reported. A group of states have said they’re considering a “range” of antitrust actions against big technology firms after meeting with Attorney General William Barr.&#92;--With assistance from Spencer Soper and Mark Gurman.To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.042,0.848,0.111,1

It may not be surprising that some of the stocks residing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average most sensitive to tariff antics really slumped today after closing lower on Thursday.The Nasdaq Composite, home to a slew of technology companies feeling the pinch of the latest tariff threat, lost 1.32% today while the S&P 500 closed lower by 0.73%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.37% to close the week with about two-thirds of the blue-chip index in the red today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now The impact of previous tariffs has been felt in multiple corners of the economy. So much so that data confirms China is no longer the biggest trading partner of the U.S. In a report out today, the Commerce Department said American exports to China slumped 18% in the first half of the year and that China is now the third-largest U.S. trading partner behind Mexico and Canada.It's unlikely that China will be regaining that top spot anytime soon, but it is probable that tariffs mean more pain for some of the following Dow stocks. Just Don't Do ItFor Nike (NYSE:NKE) investors, tariffs are very much a case of &quot;just don't do it&quot; as highlighted by the stock's 2.16% tumble today, putting it among the worst-performing Dow names for the day.The good news: today's slide in shares of Nike may be a case of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater. While the company has significant China exposure, it may be be able to endure another batch of tariffs without much pain for investors.&quot;Nike, the world's largest shoemaker, has a sizable 23% exposure to China. Surprisingly, the consensus on Wall Street is that the athletic apparel giant won't suffer from the new tariffs,&quot; according to CNBC. Dow Losers: Technology, Of CourseThe technology sector, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, is a predictable victim of the China trade spat because American tech firms either source components in China, depend on that country as a major end market, or both. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) slipped 3.86% today, making it the worst-performing name in the Dow. Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) was another tech stock taken to task, losing 2.12%.Weak price action in Apple today makes sense because the company has significant exposure to China, where many of Apple's most important products are made and sold. Of the many negative effects of tariffs, one includes that companies have to pass higher costs onto consumers. That often triggers reduced demand. Some analysts are already speculating that the new tariffs could pinch Apple.&quot;If Apple passes through the 10% tariff to consumers we could see a hit to iPhone demand by roughly 6 million to 8 million iPhones in the U.S.&quot; over the next 12 months,&quot; said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Bottom Line on the DowUnderscoring the need to play some defense over the near-term, just 10 Dow members closed higher today and only two of those names would not be considered defensive stocks. Obviously, most Dow members can be considered multi-national companies with significant export and China exposures, but there are ways to skirt trade troubles at the sector level (banks and healthcare to name a pair).Adding to the domestic focus conversation, it is relevant to state that nearly a third of the Russell 2000 reports earnings next week, notable because U.S. small-cap companies are heavily focused on their home market, not China.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

176,0.9981,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To get Brooke Sutherland’s newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.A General Electric Co. earnings release is never a straightforward event; Wednesday’s felt particularly inconclusive. Turnarounds are prone to fits and starts, and at GE, it’s apt to be a particularly long and difficult road. There was little in the latest quarter’s results to convert doubters of CEO Larry Culp’s recovery efforts into believers, and, similarly, nothing concretely terrible enough to shake supporters out of their faith. On the positive side, there were signs of stabilization in the struggling power division. The unit posted operating profit of $117 million in the quarter, down significantly from a year earlier but hey, it wasn’t a loss. Orders were up 28% on an organic basis in the gas turbine side of the business. Also, GE raised its adjusted industrial cash flow guidance and now sees the potential to actually generate as much as $1 billion for the full year. That compares with a previous call for cash flow to be at best breakeven in 2019.It’s not really clear how we got to that raised guidance, though. GE says the improved outlook reflects better-than-expected first-half results for power and health care, and lower restructuring expenses and interest costs. It now says cash flow for the power business could be flat relative to last year’s $2.3 billion burn (adjusted for the reallocation of the grid operations to the renewable energy division), versus an earlier forecast for a substantial year-over-year weakening. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch estimates a $500 million boost to expectations for the power unit. GE also said it thinks it can spend $500 million less on cash restructuring this year, while still achieving the same level of cost savings. This is odd. Recall that Culp’s predecessor John Flannery was ousted in part because of a perceived lack of urgency and aggression on cost-cutting. Analysts have debated how much more cost-cutting GE could actually do, given already comparatively low levels of back-office and R&D expenses and relatively high sales per employee. The European footprint GE inherited from the Alstom SA deal also complicates its efforts to fire people and shutter factories. For me, the lower restructuring bill raises questions as to whether the multi-year cost-cutting opportunity is as large as billed.Either way, working against the better power performance and lower restructuring expenses is GE’s estimate of a $1.4 billion hit to 2019 cash flow from operating activities if Boeing Co.’s 737 Max stays grounded through the duration of this year, a likely outcome at this point. GE provides the engine for the Max through its CFM International joint venture with Safran SA. One possible explanation is that Culp was trying to give the company room to fix itself in 2019 and set a low enough bar with his initial guidance that he could simply roll over it. Given GE’s past history with over-promising and under-delivering, I can’t knock the logic of this rationale. But if that is the case, it feels a little too carefully orchestrated. Why give guidance at all really if you’re going to be uber-conservative and continue to rely on heavily adjusted metrics? Why not let the results and the turnaround speak themselves? Perhaps the optics of a potential “beat” proved irresistible. It doesn’t change the fact that GE is losing some of its cash-generating ability through divestitures and likely to face historically low levels of cash flow for the next few years. One thing that seemed notably less carefully orchestrated was the announcement that Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller would be stepping down. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Culp said this was his decision and he felt the time was right because “things were stable enough.” That suggests it’s a change he’s been contemplating for a while and was just waiting for the proper moment, which makes it all the weirder that GE announced the reshuffling without having a replacement lined up.NEVER-ENDING TARIFFS So much for the doldrums of August. President Donald Trump kicked off the typically quiet month by announcing the U.S. would slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports not yet subject to duties because he doesn’t feel Chinese President Xi Jinping is moving “fast enough” to resolve trade tensions. The tariffs are set to take effect Sept. 1 and Trump has said he may even raise the duties to 25% or higher if talks with China continue to stall. The direct cost of this latest batch of tariffs will likely be incremental for industrial companies, with many of the products and components they import from China included in the $250 billion of goods already taxed by the Trump administration at 25%. It’s a much nastier surprise for consumer-goods companies like Apple Inc., which thus far have managed to stay out of the fray, and for the average American who’s about to see higher prices on some of their favorite toys and electronics. My Bloomberg Opinion colleagues Shira Ovide and David Fickling have great pieces out on this, which you can read here and here. But for manufacturers, this adds to a general environment of uncertainty that CSX Corp. CEO James Foote deemed “one of the most puzzling” economic backdrops of his career. With China reportedly contemplating blacklisting FedEx Corp. over the erroneous rerouting of packages involving Huawei Technologies Co. documents and products, Trump’s latest trade broadside could inspire retaliation against other U.S. companies. The slide in Boeing shares on the tariff news suggests investors are worried about backlash toward the planemaker, whether through canceled or scrapped orders or a tougher regulatory review of its grounded Max jet. More tangibly, this re-escalation of the trade war means the sales slowdown that was a frequent theme this industrial earnings season is unlikely to dissipate and instead set to get worse.This week brought more evidence of weakening demand from nVent Electric Plc, Gardner Denver Holdings Inc., Parker-Hannifin Corp. and even Siemens AG’s automation software business. The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity came in at 51.2 for the month of July, according to data released Thursday. That’s still indicates expansion, but it’s the fourth straight month of declines and the lowest reading in nearly three years. Thus far, manufacturers have generally been successful at passing along price increases and that, combined with stepped-up cost-cutting, has helped companies deliver earnings beats even as their sales growth slows. The durability of that dynamic will be tested if this wobbling in demand turns into a more clear-cut slump. There had been some hope that a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut would buoy the sector. Whatever push toward new investment may have been inspired by this week’s quarter-point reduction is likely now wiped out by this reopening of the trade-war tensions. Of course, there’s also the possibility that this tariff threat was Trump’s way of forcing the Fed into more rate cuts. Maybe it’s a bluff, like the threat to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports. Who knows? Meanwhile, the bright spots this week were strong numbers from Ingersoll-Rand Plc and Johnson Controls International Plc, which both posted much better organic sales and order growth for their HVAC businesses than we saw earlier in the reporting season from United Technologies Corp.’s Carrier unit and Lennox International Inc. We’ll see if that lasts. ROUNDING UP MORE PLAINTIFFSBayer AG is now facing lawsuits from 18,400 plaintiffs claiming the company’s Roundup weed killer caused their cancer; that represents an increase of 5,000 litigants since April. In a call this week to discuss disappointing quarterly earnings, Bayer CEO Werner Baumann moderately walked back the company’s resistance to settlement talks, saying he’d be open to a “financially reasonable” agreement as long as it resolves all Roundup litigation. The continued buildup in the number of claimants makes it less likely a settlement will meet both those criteria. Last month, a judge reduced a $2 billion jury award to a California couple to $86.7 million, following similar payout reductions in the other two Roundup cases that have gone to trial. But a lawyer representing that California couple noted that the average judgment per plaintiff now sits at $47 million. Every case is different and the awards per plaintiff are likely to be lower in a mass tort settlement, but that’s still a troubling precedent. Analysts’ estimates for a Roundup settlement range from $2.5 billion to $20 billion. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Holly Froum estimates $6 billion to $10 billion, given the surge in lawsuits, and said she’s skeptical a settlement would remove Roundup litigation risks for Bayer as non-parties who may claim injury in the future wouldn’t be bound to it. While Bayer agreed last month to sell the Dr. Scholl’s foot-care business to Yellow Wood Partners for $585 million and is looking to offload its animal-health business, the uncertainty surrounding the Roundup litigation likely limits its ability to consider a bigger breakup.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEEaton Corp.’s second-quarter results released this week did little to endear analysts and investors to its current structure. While the company’s aerospace and electrical divisions put up strong numbers despite currency pressures and a more challenging economic environment, the hydraulics and vehicle units were disappointments, yet again. Eaton now estimates organic growth in the hydraulics business will be flat to up 1% for the full year, down from a previous guide of 3% to 4%. Margin expectations for that unit were also slashed. In the vehicle division, Eaton sees as much as an 8% decline in organic sales this year. Asked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Joe Ritchie about the hydraulics unit’s long-term fit within Eaton’s portfolio, CEO Craig Arnold pointed out that the company’s overall performance was solid “despite the fact that we have one of our businesses that's not today firing on all cylinders.” That’s true, and yet while I’m wary of industrial companies’ passion for breakups going too far, “despite” is really the key word in Arnold’s comments. This isn’t a momentary slip-up for either the hydraulics or the vehicle business, and they’re increasingly perceived as more cyclical roadblocks holding up even greater margin improvement and sales growth for the overall company. Arnold has signaled in the past that if the company can’t get struggling businesses to targeted profitability levels, that could be a catalyst for divestiture.Parker-Hannifin agreed to buy Exotic Metals Forming Co. for  $1.73 billion. The name might lead you to believe this company crafts metalworks on some sort of tropical island, but it’s based in Washington and makes complex high-temperature engine components and exhaust-management systems for aircraft including the Boeing 737 Max and Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 fighter jet. On the one hand, the addition of Exotic Metals will boost the share of Parker-Hannifin’s revenue tied to faster-growing, more profitable aerospace products to more than 20% by Bloomberg Intelligence’s estimate, which will help to offset the sales slowdown in its industrial-products divisions. At about 13 times 2019 estimated adjusted Ebitda, the Exotic Metals deal is cheaper on that basis than the $3.7 billion acquisition of adhesives and coatings company Lord Corp. that Parker-Hannifin announced earlier this year. But this is another debt-fueled bet on the aerospace industry at a time when skepticism is growing about how much longer the multi-year boom in that sector will last. Exotic Metals’s already high Ebitda margin of nearly 30% and compound annual sales growth of more than 16% over the last three years leave little room for improvement. A goal of a high single-digit return on invested capital in year five for the Exotic Metals deal isn’t terribly impressive to begin with; the risk is, even that is optimistic.   nVent agreed to buy Eldon, a Spanish provider of electrical enclosures, for $130 million. This is nVent’s first takeover of size since the company was spun off from Pentair Plc in 2018. It’s a good deal for CEO Beth Wozniak to start with: the purchase price is a reasonable 1.4 times the $90 million of sales Eldon generated in 2018 and the business is clearly complementary to nVent’s existing electrical protection systems. Eldon will give nVent more products that adhere to European electrical standards, giving it access to a wider swath of customers, RBC analyst Deane Dray wrote in a report. Eldon is also a bit ahead of the curve on automation and digital initiatives and the deal could help speed nVent’s efforts in those areas. In that respect, the Eldon purchase may serve to make nVent a more well-rounded takeover target in its own right, Dray writes.  BONUS READINGRegulators Found High Risk of Emergency After First Boeing MAX Crash Bad Week for Energy Stocks?

201,0.9918,"Everyone I know seems to have a Fitbit (NYSE:FIT). But maybe that's just a thing for old white folks.Source: Shutterstock Fitbit issued a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad quarterly report July 29, with miserable guidance. It lost $68.5 million, 27 cents per share, on revenue of $313.6 million and will lose money for the full year.At a stop during a recent walk, the reason was clear. People like Fitbit trackers, but most won't spend up for the smart watch. We also don't take the tracker data seriously. It's like a Tamagotchi for grandpas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe trackers cost under $100, and the Versa Lite watch retails at $200. The Versa Lite tries to compete with the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch, but lacks key features. Apple reported $5.5 billion in revenue from &quot;wearables, home and accessories&quot; during its most recent quarter. They seem to have it figured out. A Fitbit Is Not a Medical DeviceThe problem is that the Fitbit is not a medical device. The company doesn't have enough cash to make it one. If a wearable were classed as a medical device, doctors could prescribe them to patients and huge new market opportunities would open.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now Doctors have resisted tracker data from patients, saying wearables lack accuracy. They don't know how to interpret the data and worry about legal liability.This is slowly starting to change.Some doctors have used Fitbit devices to track patients after surgery. There are hints that &quot;one more feature,&quot; like blood pressure monitoring, could be a &quot;tipping point&quot; leading to widespread use. But that remains tantalizingly far off. Fitbit is also testing a pulse sensor but has yet to release it.Apple has low-level FDA clearances for its irregular heart rhythm alert and E.C.G. A friend wrote recently that these features helped save his life.  Continuous glucose monitors, worn on the skin, can also interface directly with smart phones.The Food and Drug Administration has a software pilot program for wearables, and claims it is trying to develop a &quot;speedy&quot; review process. Apple is working with several start-ups whose apps and add-ons might connect to the Watch but the market breakthrough hasn't happened yet. No More MoneyWhile Fitbit teases its next watch as more Apple-like, integrating with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, it is running out of money.The company reported $335 million in cash in its June report, down from $474 million in December. During the first six months, it lost $147 million, meaning it could potentially run out of money in a year. That's after cutting its research budget. The company has spent $148 million on research over the last six months, down from $176 million a year ago.All this is reflected in the stock price, which has been cut in half since February, opening August 2 at $3.31. Analysts are saying &quot;just sell,&quot; calling this a winner take all market that Apple has won. This doesn't mean the game is over. Verily, which is one of the &quot;other bets&quot; of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), has gotten Class II FDA approval for its EKG monitoring, and is looking at applications in areas like PTSD and Parkinson's. It bought out the intellectual property of Fossil, another smartwatch maker, early this year.  But Verily remains a good distance from the market, and Alphabet has the money to be patient. The Bottom LineI bought a Versa Lite during the most recent quarter. I like it. But I don't take it seriously. I use it as a goad to get more exercise and better sleep. It's not a medical device. I don't talk about it with my doctor.Until doctors take wearables seriously, the space won't grow. And Fitbit lacks the cash, and the time, to get into that game.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

213,0.9959,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Smartphone sales may be stagnating, but one particular strand of technological wizardry behind them is not. Companies that make the sensors powering your phone’s camera and facial recognition system are preparing for a mini boom.The slowdown in global smartphone sales has made life tougher for semiconductor makers. Chips giants from Qualcomm Inc. to Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. have all recently issued disappointing forecasts. Pricing for memory chips is close to an all-time low.One bright spot is the market for 3-D and camera sensors. Smartphone makers are either struggling to find major new innovations, or are holding them back for handsets that are 5G-enabled and can transmit heaps of data very quickly. Meantime, the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd are pushing more incremental design improvements: Bigger displays and better cameras. The displays often require more sensors too, as fingerprint scanners make way for optical sensing systems.That’s good news for the likes of Sony Corp., Infineon Technologies AG, STMicroelectronics NV and AMS AG. All have intimated that the technology is finally gaining some traction, two years after the iPhone X first brought 3-D sensors to a mass market smartphone with Face ID.Both Sony’s and ST Micro’s sensor arms were their fastest growing business in the most recent quarter as they ramped up production for the arrival of new smartphones in the third quarter. AMS bucked the trend of recent years to forecast growth for the rest of the year that exceeds expectations.This new upswell has as much to do with photography as facial recognition. Even as handset sales drop, more advanced and therefore higher margin image sensors are going into the handsets that are still sold.Huawei and Apple have made photography a selling point. The Chinese firm’s P30 Pro is marketed with the tagline “Rewrite the Rules of Photography” and comprises five different cameras, including a front-facing one.That’s boosted demand for both image sensors and 3-D sensors, which are used to improve the focus and depth perception on the back-facing cameras, as well as for facial recognition on the front. Apple’s next top-of-the-range iPhone will include three rear-facing cameras when released later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.Alphabet Inc.’s Google will also release an updated Pixel smartphone that comprises an innovative 3-D motion sensor array that lets users control the handset without touching the screen. Much of the underlying hardware will be supplied by Infineon.It’s a promise that is overdue. AMS had anticipated a far faster return on its significant investment in the technology. It mistimed its spending and the stock has suffered as a consequence. Infineon, Sony and STMicro have invested in a steadier fashion and benefit from the deep pockets that their other businesses afford them.One reason for the recent uptick in adoption is the arrival of a new class of “time-of-flight” sensors. The iPhone’s Face ID relies on a more complex system known as “structured light.” Not only have Apple’s supplier exclusivity agreements made it harder for rivals to imitate its approach, but the technology’s complexity makes it trickier and more expensive to implement.Time-of-flight gear works the way it sounds, by measuring how long it takes for a laser signal to bounce off an object and inferring its topography accordingly. It requires fewer components and is generally more robust, reducing the risk of breakage and therefore wastage in the manufacturing process.STMicro has a close working relationship with Apple, so may benefit most from the next iPhone. Sony works with the Cupertino, California-based firm too, but has also benefited from the rise of Huawei’s smartphone business. Google’s smartphone business remains small, limiting the upside for Infineon, but its handsets become design standards for others that run on the search giant’s Android operating system. That positions Infineon well for further design wins.Usually, new technology gets industrial applications before filtering down to consumers. When it comes to 3-D sensors, it’s the reverse. Companies such as STMicro and Infineon are building relationships with suppliers that will continue when the sensors go into factories in a few years’ time. Yet more devices will go into cars, monitoring driver behavior and attention. Things are looking up.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Baker at stebaker@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

214,0.9662,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said on Thursday it is suspending its global internal program for “grading” a portion of user Siri commands after some consumers raised concerns about the program. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant employs people that listen to less than 1% of Siri commands in order to improve the voice-based digital assistant. Concerns over technology companies listening to and analyzing what is spoken to voice assistants started to be raised after Bloomberg News first reported that Amazon.com Inc. and Apple had teams analyzing recordings earlier this year. Last week, the Guardian reported that Apple contractors said that they often hear sex, drug deals and confidential medical information.  “We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy,” Apple said in a statement. “While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.”The company’s move comes the same week that a German regulator temporarily stopped Google employees and contractors from transcribing home assistant voice recordings in the European Union after whistleblowers said some recordings contained sensitive information. A Hamburg agency said Aug. 1 that Google agreed to a three-month stoppage while it investigates whether the practice complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.Bloomberg News reported in April that Amazon employs thousands of people around the world who listen to voice recordings captured by its line of Echo speakers in owners’ homes and offices, with the goal of improving its Alexa digital assistant. The recordings are transcribed, annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa’s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands.Apple’s Siri also has human helpers, who work to gauge whether the digital assistant’s interpretation of requests lines up with what the person said. The recordings they review lack personally identifiable information and are stored for six months tied to a random identifier, according to an Apple security white paper. The company doesn’t disclose directly in iOS that it uses a portion of recordings for its “grading” process, but it is mentioned in the white paper.(Updates with Google’s suspension in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.007,0.921,0.071,1
215,0.8857,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans reading gloomy headlines about the trade war with China could be forgiven for wondering what all the fuss is about.Bloomberg’s consumer comfort index, a weekly phone survey conducted since 1985, is running at its highest levels since 2000. Similar gauges of the household sector, such as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index and the Conference Board’s various consumer confidence surveys, are posting the best results since the eve of the early 2000s recession.That’s a stark contrast to what’s happening in industry. The ISM Manufacturing Index eased to its lowest level since President Donald Trump’s election, and the Markit Manufacturing PMI is flirting with outright contraction with its weakest reading since September 2009 in July. Measures of industrial production are barely growing and the Conference Board’s leading index in June fell at the fastest pace since early 2016.One explanation for what’s happening is that households haven’t yet felt the impact of U.S.-China tensions. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has been careful to spare them by exempting most retail products from the 25% tariffs he’s imposed on $250 billion of goods so far. With Trump’s promise Thursday to add a 10% levy on the remaining goods trade between the two countries from Sept. 1, that’s about to change.There’s a range of popular consumer products for which America is still deeply dependent on Chinese imports. As my colleague Shira Ovide notes, Apple Inc. could be one of the biggest victims: Telephones (mostly mobile handsets like the iPhone) and computers are the two biggest categories of U.S. imports from China.Other goods where China accounts for more than half of U.S. imports include toys and games; computer accessories; shoes; televisions; drapery and linen; and leather goods and luggage. That large share of the total is important, because one of the best ways of minimizing the risk of higher prices for consumers is for imports to diversify to other countries such as Mexico and Vietnam. When China makes up more than 50% of the import market, rejigging supply chains becomes extraordinarily challenging.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could take some of the edge off the pain by further cutting interest rates, after lowering them this week for the first time in a decade. Three-month overnight interest swaps are trading at 2.05%, indicating that traders expect a further quarter-point cut before Thanksgiving.Still, it would be a mistake to think the impact of such a move would be straightforward. Powell’s initial shift away from raising rates helped spark a fall in the Chinese yuan against the dollar of about 3.9% between mid-April and mid-May as currency traders bet on a relative strengthening of the U.S. economy. The renminbi is now just a fraction above its weakest levels in a decade. But that’s still not enough to offset a 10% tariff, and most of the effects of exchange-rate movements aren’t passed through to consumer goods anyway. After the trade-related shocks of the past year, the ebullient state of the American consumer is potent testimony to the resilience of the U.S. economy. But even that has limits. A one-tenth hike in the price of regularly purchased items like clothing, toys and consumer electronics risks exhausting households’ patience, especially as the decade-long fall in unemployment rates starts to bottom out.There’s likely to be feedback effects, too. To the extent that industrial conditions are still mildly positive at the moment, that probably owes a great deal to the fact that consumers are in an extremely good mood. By threatening to bring the trade turmoil to U.S. households, Trump risks upsetting that delicate balance.Equity markets are still in a bullish state, but beneath the surface the American economy has been disappointing expectations for the past six months. Further imposts on the consumer aren’t going to help it turn that corner.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

216,-0.9923,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.President Donald Trump abruptly escalated his trade war with China, announcing that he would impose a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports in a move set to hit American consumers more directly than any other in his trade wars so far.The new import taxes, which Trump later said could go “well beyond” 25%, will be imposed beginning Sept. 1 on a long list of goods expected to include smart-phones, laptop computers and children’s clothing. They will come on top of the 25% duty in place already on some $250 billion in Chinese goods and mean that almost all trade with China will be subject to new taxes.The threat marks the biggest escalation so far taken by the Trump administration and brings a surprise end to a truce that had been in place since the president met Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, in Osaka at the end of June. Markets, which had been up ahead of the news, tumbled with all three major equity indices closing down by around 1% and bond yields sinking. Oil plunged almost 8% for the steepest one-day drop in more than four years.Stocks slid at the open in Asia Friday and U.S. futures dropped. Chinese and Hong Kong stocks opened lower and the yuan fell.The CSI 300 Index declined 2.2% at 9:30 a.m. local-time open, led by technology and telecom companies, while the offshore yuan weakened 0.2% to 6.9692 per dollar to approach the key 7 level. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped to a seven-week low.China’s response to the escalation is complicated by the fact that the Communist Party’s top leadership is likely decamping this week to the seaside resort of Beidaihe for their annual two-week policy enclave. Officials from Xi downward disappear from public view as they privately debate policy. In a tweet, Trump said China had not lived up to a promise Xi made in Osaka to buy U.S. agricultural goods and to halt illegal exports of fentanyl. The president later told reporters he’s “not concerned at all” about the negative reaction from markets.“I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I’m not sure,” Trump said in a Thursday evening rally in Cincinnati. “Until such time that there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China.”Six people familiar with the discussions said that during meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Shanghai earlier this week the Chinese side had also made no new proposals. That had left the way out of an impasse in talks over the substance of a deal that the two sides hit in May unclear, which prompted the administration to decide to increase pressure further on Beijing at a White House meeting Thursday.In comments to reporters, Trump said there were no plans to reverse a decision made in Osaka to allow more sales by U.S. suppliers of non-sensitive products to blacklisted Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co.Trump in a series of tweets announcing the new tariffs left the door open to further talks.“We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!” he said. Later, speaking to reporters as he departed the White House for the campaign rally, he complained that Xi isn’t “going fast enough.”Both China and the U.S. said after this week’s talks that their negotiators would regroup in Washington in early September. People close to the administration said they were still planning for those talks to go ahead.What Our Economists Say“Assuming Trump’s tweet becomes policy, we’d expect a proportionate reaction from China. That would mean more tariffs on imports from the U.S. We don’t think China would shoot itself in the foot with harassment of U.S. firms or sales of U.S. Treasuries.”Tom Orlik and Carl Riccadonna, Bloomberg EconomicsClick here for the full research noteBut they also said the president and his advisers had grown increasingly wary of what appeared to be China’s efforts to extend the talks into next year with an eye toward a possible change of administration after the 2020 presidential elections. That feeling, they said, had only grown since Osaka on the back of China’s failure to live up to its promise to ramp up agricultural purchases and the outcome of the Shanghai meeting appeared to confirm that.China has insisted that it wants to see all tariffs lifted as part of a deal. But according to one person familiar with the discussions, Chinese negotiators in Shanghai insisted that levies would have to be lifted before they would deliver on any reforms, something the U.S. has said it would not commit to.Trump rejected the advice of Mnuchin and ruled out giving Beijing advance notice of the tariffs during a White House meeting shortly before announcing the move in a tweet.A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington referred inquiries to the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing.The tariff move drew an immediate angry response from a U.S. business community that has been pushing for Trump to end a trade war that they see as increasingly weighing on the U.S. and global economies. Federal Reserve ChairmanJerome Powell on Wednesday cited the risk of escalating trade tensions as a major one for the U.S. economy as the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, mentioning the word trade 26 times in his news conference.“Raising tariffs by 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports from China will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong U.S. economy,” said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.A draft list of $300 billion worth of targets published by the Trump administration as talks started to break down in May included a raft of consumer and technology goods, including most of Apple Inc.’s major products such as the IPhone, along with toys, footwear and clothing. The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office said it will release the final, official list of products in the coming days.“These are the tariffs on many of the consumer goods that were spared in the previous tariff rounds,” said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research in New York, in a note. “This is a small hit to growth but will likely be more obvious to consumers. Keep in mind that margins have come in somewhat already, not sure firms can simply eat the cost.”Analysts said the decision to walk away from the Osaka truce indicated a level of desperation by an administration whose efforts to force China to commit to economic reforms were going nowhere.U.S. officials reported to Trump that Chinese negotiators refused to commit to to improving intellectual-property laws, cracking down on fentanyl trafficking, or buying more from American farmers until a comprehensive and binding trade deal is sealed, according to several people briefed on the matter.Trump’s “trade war with China has failed and he is doubling down on a failing strategy,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The whole purpose of the tariffs was to force China to make structural changes to its economy. But the tariffs have failed to do that. China is prepared to live with the pain rather than make the changes the U.S. wants.”Victor Shih, a China expert at the University of California San Diego, said if the tariffs were imposed as threatened Beijing would find new ways to respond.“If this were to go into effect, China almost certainly will retaliate in some fashion,” Shih said. “The soft delays and suspension in purchasing Boeing aircraft may harden into official policy. Also, China may impose fines and restrictions over services vendors with large presence in Greater China.”(Updates with Beidaihe meeting in 6th paragraphjb)&#92;--With assistance from David Wainer, Mike Dorning, Jennifer A.

225,0.9773,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing acquisitions by Facebook Inc. as part of an early stage antitrust investigation of the social media platform, according to people familiar with the matter.The agency’s look at whether the company acquired upstarts to thwart competition is part of the broad probe into into several business lines -- social media, digital advertising and mobile applications -- that Facebook disclosed in July.The commission has contacted third parties that could aid in the investigation as it tries to understand competitive dynamics, Bloomberg reported. The people asked not to be named because the inquiry is confidential.Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The agency’s scrutiny of Facebook’s acquisitions was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.The Trump administration is escalating antitrust scrutiny of technology giants. Last month, the Justice Department’s antitrust division announced a broad review into whether the companies are using their power to thwart competition. In February, the FTC set up a task force to investigate potentially anticompetitive conduct in the industry and look at past mergers to determine if they should be unwound.Trump DOJ Escalates Big Tech Scrutiny With New Antitrust ProbeFacebook’s critics, including co-founder Chris Hughes, have called for antitrust enforcers to break up the company, arguing it shouldn’t have been allowed to buy Instagram and the WhatsApp messaging service. Both deals were approved by the agency when they were announced, and persuading a court to undo them would be a steep challenge, according to antitrust experts.If the FTC decided to bring a lawsuit to unwind the deals -- despite having approved them -- it would need to show that Facebook eliminated competitors by buying the apps. Facebook would counter that the companies only flourished because of the resources they gained from being part of the social-media company.When Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, the photo-sharing app had just 30 million users. At the time, Facebook had lost almost half its value since its initial public offering earlier that year amid investor concerns about whether it could make money from the mobile version of its service. Now Facebook has 2.4 billion monthly active users, and Instagram has more than 1 billion.Facebook has made dozens of acquisitions over the years, though only a handful are well known. In 2014, it bought WhatsApp for $19 billion before picking up Oculus, a maker of virtual reality headsets, for $2 billion just a month later. Virtual reality hasn’t captured a mainstream audience the way Facebook hopes it will, but WhatsApp has taken off. While it still doesn’t generate big profits for Facebook, it’s amassed more than 1.5 billion users around the world.Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech Assault“There are a lot of other transactions that Facebook has engaged in that the FTC could say, ‘Well look, allowing these transactions was a mistake,’” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the media policy group Public Knowledge.Although the company may not worry because a breakup is less likely than other moves such as privacy legislation, it’s arguably the most scary option for Facebook in Washington, Feld said. Even an investigation could prove damaging, he added.“How long is this going to go on?” Feld said. “How expensive is it going to be and how much is this going to cramp your style?”Facebook has argued repeatedly that breaking up the company won’t fix the tech industry’s biggest problems -- those around election integrity and user privacy. Facebook has instead pushed for more government regulation, asking lawmakers to put guardrails in place to help dictate rules for the internet so tech companies don’t have to. Facebook’s top executives have also claimed, repeatedly, that breaking up the company might pave the way for companies from other countries, like China, to fill the void.The FTC and the antitrust division have divvied up the biggest tech firms with Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. going to the FTC, and the Justice Department getting Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.(Updates with analysis of antitrust issues from seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net;Daniel Stoller in Arlington at dstoller1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.035,0.888,0.077,1

233,-0.0896,"(Bloomberg) -- The worst may soon be over for an electronics slump that has dogged Asia’s export-driven economies.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists said a rebound in technology exports is overdue, citing gradual improvement in South Korean trade and evidence the memory-chip cycle is reaching its low point.While South Korean semiconductor shipments plunged 28% by value in July, they rose 15% by volume. The nation’s inventories of semiconductors fell a second straight month in June, a sign that orders are picking up.“The question is when South Korea’s exports will bottom out,” said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul. “It could be the third quarter, either August or September.”The slump in tech exports has been one of the biggest drags on Asia’s manufacturing base. Key gauges for factory sentiment continue to show contractions for output in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. Real investment growth across Asia slowed to 2% in the first quarter from 7% a year ago, according to S&P Global Ratings.Industry announcements across Asia signal a possible recovery, which is good news for a region that accounts for more than 60% of global economic growth.Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s biggest memory-chip maker, said Wednesday that data centers -- its biggest customers -- have started buying again, causing demand to increase.The world’s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., surprised analysts last month when it projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates. TSMC’s business has bottomed out and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said. The Apple Inc. supplier sees “very, very strong demand” in the second half of 2019, he said.Smartphone DemandApple’s suppliers -- dominated by Asia-based factories -- are preparing to produce components for up to 75 million new iPhones in the second half, roughly the same number as a year earlier, Bloomberg News reported.Apple’s sales forecast of $61 billion-$64 billion for the current quarter not only topped analysts’ estimates but also signaled year-over-year revenue could grow, thanks to healthy demand for iPhones.Another reason for optimism is that Samsung will begin selling its Galaxy Fold smartphone in September. The world’s biggest handset maker hopes the foldable phones, coupled with fifth-generation wireless networks, will kick the mobile industry back into a boom by giving consumers a compelling reason to upgrade their devices.“It’s been pretty awful but probably not as bleak going forward as it has been,” Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said of the tech cycle.Early DaysFor sure, it’s too early to say for certain the worst is over.After all, Singapore’s electronics exports fell in June to their lowest since at least 1997. In Japan, shipments of electronic components and chip-making equipment to China both dropped by well over 20% in June.Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore, said that while the electronics sector may bottom late this year, “significant downside risks remain.”In addition to the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing global economy, demand for new smartphones is plateauing. Rising tensions between Japan and South Korea could also hurt. Japan has already slapped curbs on exports to South Korea of materials vital to manufacturing of semiconductors and displays, and things could get worse.“Even before the trade war hit, there was a bit of a moderation in the tech cycle,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “Smartphones have reached a saturation point.”Still, optimists argue that comparisons with robust growth numbers for electronics exports from a year ago is making the weakness look worse than it is.Beyond smartphones, Asia is also leading spending on the Internet of Things, accounting for around 36% of global spending this year, followed by the U.S. and Western Europe with 27% and 21%, respectively.“Initial shocks from the trade war might be behind us,” Goldman economists wrote in a note.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Enda Curran in Hong Kong at ecurran8@bloomberg.net;Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net;Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, Henry Hoenig, Nasreen SeriaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.087,0.816,0.097,0

241,0.9966,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. executives have for months been publicly optimistic that everything will turn out fine in the trade battle between the U.S. and China. Well, maybe not.President Donald Trump on Thursday tweeted — of course — that the U.S. plans to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of goods imported from China. Smartphones are among the consumer products that haven’t been subject to earlier tariff rounds, but it’s fair to assume they will be if the U.S. moves ahead with duties on all remaining Chinese imports. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook likes to say that Apple’s smartphones are products of the world, and they are. But the bulk of iPhone manufacturing and assembly takes place in China. That means the U.S.-China trade war may finally be coming for Apple, and it shows that Cook’s personal diplomacy with the White House and in Beijing didn’t necessarily spare his company. If Trump imposes the fresh tariffs and Apple raises prices in response on the estimated 70 million or so iPhones sold in the U.S. each year, it most likely won’t crater sales, but it won’t be great for an already fragile smartphone market. Apple shares were trading down about 2% after Trump’s tweet. Shipments of smartphones have been falling globally, and signs have continued that people in the U.S. and some other countries are holding onto their phones for longer. AT&T Inc. said recently that a record-low share of its wireless monthly customers, just 3.3%, opted to buy a new smartphone model in the second quarter. Apple has been trying to lower iPhone prices through various means, and that might be tough if the company has to figure out how to manage a 10% tariff, too.Apple’s only significant smartphone rival in the U.S., Samsung Electronics Co., spreads its manufacturing assembly around the world a bit more than Apple does. It’s not clear how many of Samsung’s smartphones sold in the U.S. might be subject to fresh U.S. tariffs. Apple investors have been well aware of the risk of tariffs landing on the company’s doorstep, but the company has essentially told them not to worry. U.S. tariffs didn’t come up in Apple’s quarterly earnings call this week. In prior sessions, Cook and other executives have sounded confident that trade negotiations between the U.S. and China were improving and would eventually be resolved amicably.“I can’t predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this, and we are hoping that calm heads prevail,” Cook told investors last year. He has echoed those comments at several points since then. That optimism has meant that Apple has said little publicly about its potential hit from tariffs, whether it would pass along costs to consumers or absorb them, or what steps it might take to mitigate the impact, such as moving some manufacturing out of China. (Apple’s primary iPhone manufacturing partner, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has talked about having the capacity to make iPhones outside of China.) It’s also possible that if tariffs are imposed on iPhones in the U.S., there will be ripple effects, such as China — one of Apple’s most important consumer markets — retaliating in some way against Apple products. Apple’s army of suppliers may feel the impact, too. That’s all to say that even if Apple is well prepared for the potential arrival of tariffs on its most important product, the company’s investors and most likely some of its many partners do not necessarily know about those preparations. Optimism is the attitude of a healthy person. But caution, or at least an indication that Apple has a sensible plan B, may have been a better strategy when dealing with uncertain geopolitical fights. To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

253,0.8855,"A day or so before the latest Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings report my finger hovered over the sell button on my shares of Apple stock.Source: Shutterstock This is the third time I've owned Apple. I've lost money in Apple. I've missed its most spectacular moves up and, ignoring conventional wisdom, stayed for some of its most shuddering falls.I had bought soon after its disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report last November, after it had dropped from its all-time high of $230 to a more comfortable $209 per share. Since then it has been at $146 in December, and $175 last month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy finger hovered, but it stayed up. I decided to wait on the earnings report. It was a winner. Apple stock rose to $219.This taught me an important lesson, one worth sharing.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends  When It Comes to AAPL Stock, RelaxApple is what you call a &quot;core holding,&quot; because the iPhone represents an inflection point in the global economy.Before the late Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, the internet was a desktop thing. You reached people with the phone network. You bought things by walking into stores.That world is hard to even comprehend now. The iPhone, and its competitors, have made everyone part of the world market. Africans, South Asians, people in what were the most remote quarters of the globe, are now instantly accessible over the internet. They're part of the global conversation.This has dropped the cost of doing business to the floor. The productivity of the smartphone, combined with the cloud, has destroyed millions of jobs, putting whole industries on their back.You don't fight that. You don't time that. You just put some money into it and go about your business.When Jobs spoke, Apple had 12-month trailing revenues of $27 billion. In 2018, revenue was $265 billion. Under Tim Cook, who took over after Jobs' death in 2011, some quarters have shown year-over-year sales falling by as much as 14%.  But if you just sat tight, you have a gain of 685%, you have 7 times more shares than you did and you have a steady stream of dividends. Ignore the NoiseWe live in revolutionary times. Clouds and devices like the iPhone are the revolution.The companies behind this revolution represent core holdings you should maintain. Don't buy or sell a core holding. Just sit on it. Ignore the noise.Other companies I consider core at this time are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Visa (NYSE:V) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A big bank like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should be there, maybe Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). You can argue for Square (NASDAQ:SQ) or Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW).I don't hold all these stocks, but I leave the ones I do own alone. I ignore the headlines. I treat them like a piggy bank. I'll open it when I need it, not before. I'll let time do its magic for me. The Bottom Line on Apple StockThe deflationary impact of clouds and devices are the most important change of this decade.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond You must be in the stocks leading this revolution, even if it means having a portfolio that leans more heavily into technology than previously.There will be other revolutions coming, because clouds and devices accelerate the pace of all change -- social, political and economic. Given the state of the climate, that's the only hope I can give your grandchildren.Apple leads the device side of the revolution. The Apple Watch will open almost as many opportunities as the iPhone did, once its capabilities break beyond Apple's walled garden, into the larger mass market.Core holdings aren't perfect companies. But just ignore the noise and hold them. Your patience will be rewarded.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

256,0.9994,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lead the list of U.S. commercial solar installation, according to &quot;Solar Means Business,&quot; a newly released report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).Apple tops the list, with 393 megawatts (MW) installed in the last three years, and Amazon comes in second, with 330 MW installed. Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also in the top 10.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, according to the study, 2018 ranks as the second-largest year for commercial solar installations, with 1,144 MW installed. And the biggest news SEIA shared is that &quot;more than half of all corporate solar capacity has been installed in the last three years.&quot;Clearly, the solar industry is gaining momentum. And that momentum is building at the exact same moment that global demand for solar power is about to go parabolic.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August I've been studying and investing in the solar market for several years now. And as far as I see it, two catalysts are fueling the solar boom.First, I'll show you these three profit triggers -- and then I'll show you how to profit from them. Solar Profit Trigger No. 1: Falling Costs, Rising EfficiencyThe cost of solar-power installations has been plummeting -- in both the residential and utility-scale markets. In many parts of the world, solar power is still more expensive than conventional power-generation technologies, but the gap is closing very rapidly.According to the SEIA report, U.S. solar costs have fallen by 65% over the last decade. In 2009, on average, installing a solar panel cost $8.50 per watt. Now its costs just a little less than $3.Meanwhile, solar-panel efficiency has skyrocketed over the past decade or so.In 1954, when Bell Labs invented the first useful silicon solar panel, they were about 6% efficient. We didn't achieve 20% efficiency until the mid-2010s, less than five years ago. Today, manufacturers are making panels with 30% efficiency.And they've reached 45% efficiency in the lab. Solar Profit Trigger No. 2: The Big Boys Step InFurther, the true cost comparison between solar power and other technologies involves more than just dollars and cents. Clearly, the toxic emissions that spew from coal-fired plants impose a cost on the planet that solar panels do not.That's why India and China -- the two most populous, and two of the most polluted, countries on the planet -- are ramping up their solar-power capacity.Both of these countries have devoted themselves to solar power, like teenagers to tattoos, and both countries have laid out ambitious plans to expand their solar footprints.Of course, sinking costs, rising efficiency and the burgeoning demand for solar power from China and India are not the only reasons to expect global demand to soar over the next several years… Solar Profit Trigger No. 3: The X FactorA powerful new &quot;X factor&quot; has entered the solar energy market -- and it has the potential to supercharge demand.That X factor is energy storage (aka batteries).Until recently, solar-power installations lacked the ability to store energy. They were simply use-it-or-lose-it power generators. Energy storage technologies were too expensive to be viable additions to solar-power facilities.But this old story is changing rapidly. Energy storage has arrived - and its arrival could be a very big deal for the solar industry.In the &quot;olden days&quot; of 2015, a company like Target would contract with a solar company to install solar panels on the roofs of its superstores. Once installed, the panels would deliver daytime electricity to supplement the electricity Target pulled from the regional power grid.But now, when Target installs new rooftop panels, it often also installs a battery system to store the excess energy it doesn't use immediately.In 2017, Target kicked off its solar-storage project at its store in Kailua-Kona, on the big island of Hawaii's east coast. There it installed a 910-kilowatt solar system from SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) that included a 250-kilowatt energy storage component.This may have been the first time a Target store had added energy storage to solar -- but it won't be the last.By the end of this year, Target expects to install rooftop solar systems on more than 500 store locations. And by 2030, the company plans to meet 100% of its energy needs from renewable sources.Utilities are also embracing energy storage. Increasingly, they are opting to add new generating capacity by building energy-plus-storage facilities, rather than gas- or coal-fired power plants.Last year, for example, the Arizona Public Service committed to deploying 850 megawatts (MW) of energy storage over the next six years. Along the same lines, NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced plans to deploy a 409 MW solar-plus-storage solution at Florida Power & Light Co., replacing two gas-fired power plants.Looking globally, the deployment of battery-based energy storage solutions (BESS) is ramping up quickly. According to JPMorgan, the cumulative installed base of BESS will soar 100-fold between now and 2030.The bottom line: Solar is big - and getting bigger. A $4 Trillion OpportunityAt the end of 2018, the world's installed capacity of solar-power generation totaled nearly half a billion megawatts -- accounting for more than 7% of the globe's power capacity.But new capacity installations are on track to soar 25% this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and to nearly double by 2021.Many forecasts anticipate an equally spectacular growth trajectory. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) &quot;Sustainable Development Scenario,&quot; solar-power capacity will soar fivefold between now and 2025, accounting for a whopping 38% of global power generation.Looking further out, the IEA anticipates a 13-fold increase in solar-power capacity by 2040, at which point this renewable source would be providing two-thirds of the world's power needs.The IEA anticipates global spending on solar power to total $4 trillion over the next two decades -- or about $180 billion per year.If investment of this magnitude were to occur, solar power would become the world's primary electricity source by 2040.But you don't have to wait 20 years to profit on this trend.There are a lot of companies out there that are jumping on the solar bandwagon, and there is clearly a lot of investing potential here.But it's all about finding the right companies that offer significant long-term potential.That's why I've just released a special &quot;all solar&quot; edition of my brand-new newsletter - Fry's Investment Report.In it, I share two recommendations to get investors in on this technology's profit ground floor.To learn more, I strongly suggest you go here to find out how to join Fry's Investment Report.Eric Fry is thhttps://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT410381&eid=MKT419624&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=starte resident expert on global investment trends at InvestorPlace. And he and his members have been experiencing much success when it comes to solar over the past year or so. In late October 2018, Eric recommended buying some call options on a solar-focused exchange-traded fund. By late January, that ETF had soared more than 30%. (Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 Index advanced just 3%.) The way Eric played it, readers who followed his advice ended up making 203% on their entire position - in just a smidgeon over three months. And in early October 2018, Eric suggested they get in on a certain solar stock's call options. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed more than 75%. They've closed out the first third of that option trade for 168% gains… and the second third for gains of 282%. And they're still sitting on 200%+ gains with the final third of that trade.

263,0.9963,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) stock made an impression following the company's earnings report. GOOGL stock price shot higher by 9.7% on July 26 in the wake of  the results. That was the largest one-day gain by Alphabet stock in four years.Source: Shutterstock The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of Alphabet stock is just above 22, well below its average PE of the last five years, which is closer to 35. Still, with analysts expecting earnings growth of 10.7% in 2019, it remains unclear whether investors will continue to pile into Alphabet stock. However, Alphabet may be able  to lift GOOGL stock price going forward. Alphabet on the MoveAlphabet stock has dropped in the wake of Google's results, but GOOGL stock price still stood at $1,231 per share in early afternoon trading. When a company beats analysts' average earnings per share estimate by $2.75 and registers 19.2% revenue growth despite its large size, investors have to take notice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 I have been a detractor of Alphabet stock in the past for many reasons. Alphabet holds over $121 billion of cash, but doesn't pay a dividend. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and, recently, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are increasingly competitive with Google in the online ad market. Alphabet stock also has regularly traded at a higher multiple compared to Facebook or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), often without growing more rapidly.Moreover, to the benefit (and perhaps also to the detriment) of Alphabet stock, the company has become what I called a &quot;wellspring of innovation.&quot; What began as a search engine has now become a conglomerate. From the self-driving cars of Waymo to Google Glass, Alphabet continues to invent products which could each support separate companies.Despite my criticisms, Alphabet stock will rise, perhaps faster than the S&P 500. However, the company's conglomerate structure is likely to hamper GOOGL stock price. For example, some  estimate the value of Waymo alone at $175 billion. Even after its July 26 run-up, the market cap of Alphabet stock stands at about $850 billion, suggesting that Alphabet would be more highly valued if it separated into multiple businesses Will the DOJ Probe Hurt the Owners of Alphabet Stock?Alphabet now faces an antitrust probe by the Department of Justice (DOJ). I do not think DOJ  will break up the company.However, a breakup could be the best thing to ever happen to the owners of Alphabet stock.. When the government broke up Standard Oil, the combined value of the  separate companies created by the break-up exceeded the value of Standard Oil  by more than fourfold. After the breakup of AT&T (NYSE:T) in 1984, much of the company came back together, and its valuation was more than twice as high as that of the original AT&T stock.Given those facts, it seems like the holders of Alphabet stock should root for the DOJ to divide the company. Or if they feel such a move is too extreme, they should at least push GOOGL to unlock some of this value. I realize Alphabet will not let go of all of its inventions, nor should it. Still, if the company can spin off some of its creations, Alphabet stock and the subsequent stocks created could generate larger gains for shareholders. Paying a dividend would also likely boost Alphabet  stock by making it attractive to a new group of investors. The Bottom Line on Alphabet StockPerhaps the potential of Alphabet stock will be unlocked by antitrust measures. More likely, the company will increase  GOOGL stock price through  its own actions. Still, until the market become more aware of Alphabet's initiatives, traders will not benefit from the full potential of GOOGL stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

272,0.9956,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I wrote recently about why Amazon.com Inc.’s commercial messages in product searches are a risky way to levy additional fees on the companies that sell through its digital mall. Apple Inc. is increasingly wading into similar waters.Type in “maps” or “dating apps” in the search bar of Apple’s widely used iPhone app storefront, and you might see a result for Google Maps or the Tinder app shaded in blue and labeled as an ad. Developers pay Apple when someone taps on those promotions. Apple has been selling those ad spots for several years as a way for developers to stand out in the sea of iPhone apps. For the second consecutive quarter, Apple executives boasted in some detail about the growth of these App Store advertisements. On a conference call on Tuesday, Apple said that revenue from these search ads doubled or more in the company’s fiscal third quarter ended in June. Three months earlier, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that app search advertising was “growing very, very fast” as Apple expanded those paid promotions into more countries. “It’s definitely a business that is big and getting bigger,” Cook told financial analysts in April. Remember, though, that some prominent app developers have been complaining about Apple’s up to 30% commission on in-app digital purchases or other terms that those developers think are unfair.(1) A group of app buyers is pursuing a lawsuit that contends Apple’s commissions ratchet up app prices for consumers.Apple’s search ads for apps — like the product search promotions on Amazon — are effectively an additional commission on top of what developers may already be paying. It’s common for app companies to devote marketing spending to promote their products on spots such as Facebook. But when some of that budget goes to the company that also is the sole distributor of iPhone apps, it raises the specter of price-gouging or conflicts of interest. Developers may believe if they don’t pay to promote their apps, a competitor will grab a top spot instead — or perhaps Apple’s own apps may be more prominent. Apple says 84% of apps distributed through its App Store don’t pay any commissions. All of those, however, could pay Apple for ads. If developers have to pay more for their apps to get noticed, they may have to charge consumers more. Apple has said that the App Store has been a boon to many developers and that it doesn’t treat its own apps any differently from those of competitors. “We’re well aware that developers have many options for distributing their apps, and that’s why we work hard to make it easy, fair and a great opportunity for them to develop apps for our customers,” the company said in a statement. Developers may believe that buying ads from Apple is more than worth the cost, and Apple has been less aggressive with its App Store ads than Amazon has been with its paid promotions tied to people’s product searches. For Apple, those ads are a fresh way to make money from a captive audience of roughly 900 million iPhone owners. Apple needs new revenue streams as a significant share of its sales is tied directly or indirectly to the sagging smartphone market. Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated Apple could eventually generate $3 billion to $4 billion a year from those App Store search promotions and other advertising. That’s roughly on par with the revenue Sacconaghi has been expecting from Apple’s coming online entertainment service, Apple TV+, which is receiving far more attention than those little search ads.  Sacconaghi also said his estimate of nearly $2 billion in search ad revenue for Apple in fiscal 2020 may be too low. Those ads are probably highly profitable to Apple, too. Fairly or unfairly, muscular companies such as Amazon and Apple will now face more scrutiny when they seek to generate more revenue from their hold on online shopping or smartphone systems. Lawmakers and regulators are interested in whether these tech superpowers are playing fairly, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that Amazon and Apple should not be allowed to both control powerful distribution platforms that many companies rely on and also sell their own items through the same system.The attention means there could be a high cost for Apple’s fresh stream of app advertising revenue. A version of this column originally appeared in Bloomberg’s Fully Charged technology newsletter. You can sign up here.(1) Google’s commissions are the same in its Android app store, and some companies such as Amazon, Spotify and Netflix don't use Android's in-app payments system so they don't need to pay commissions to Google. Those developers don't use Apple's in-app purchasing for similar reasons, although Apple has stricter rules about employing these kinds of workarounds.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

274,0.9936,"Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have provided investors with outstanding performance so far this year. In fact, MSFT stock is up nearly 40% this year. Microsoft is an appealing company for investors because the growth in its underlying businesses has allowed Microsoft to generate massive amounts of cash flows. Microsoft is a high-quality company because it generates a massive amount of cash, has phenomenal dividend growth and it is not in the anti-trust cross-hairs as many other large companies are.Source: Shutterstock With all of that in mind, let's take a deeper look into each of these positive aspects that make Microsoft stock an appealing pick for any portfolio. MSFT Cash FlowsThere's an old saying -- &quot;cash is king&quot; -- and I view MSFT as the king in that regard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs of the end of the most recent quarter, Microsoft had over $130 billion in cash on its balance sheet. In addition, over the last four quarters, Microsoft has generated $38 billion in free cash flow. The substantial amount of cash on the balance sheet and cash generated by the business allows Microsoft to pay increasing dividends and invest in future growth areas. For example, Microsoft recently invested $1 billion in OpenAI and had another initiative to train 15,000 people in AI-related skills by 2022. This shows Microsoft is investing in what will be one of the most important technological areas in the coming decades.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond  Stellar Dividend  Click to Enlarge Source: Zacks Investment Research The dividend for Microsoft is one of the safest if not the safest dividends in the market. The reason for this is the large amount of cash on the balance sheet, cash flow generation and the fact Microsoft is one of only two AAA rated companies. Going forward, I expect that Microsoft will continue to increase their dividend at a rate of 8-10% per year, with the next increase likely announced in mid-September.  Click to Enlarge Source: Zacks Investment Research Even with the stellar dividend and stable dividend-growth, the dividend yield for MSFT stock is only 1.31%. The reason for the low dividend is that the stock has moved up in price so much this year. The following chart shows the dividend yield for Microsoft is at a historically low level. I expect that when Microsoft announces a dividend increase in September, it will be a quarterly dividend around 50 cents per share.Since the beginning of 2018, the dividend yield has ranged from 2% to the current 1.30%. If Microsoft were to return to the mid-point of that range at a yield of 1.65% with a potential quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, that would imply a stock price of around $121. I believe a pullback would be healthy for the stock and create an opportunity for potential investors. Microsoft Eludes Current Anti-Trust TroublesEven though Microsoft has a $1 trillion market cap, they were left off the list of companies that are coming under scrutiny from Washington D.C. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all in the cross-hairs for various reasons.Since Microsoft is not in the cross-hairs, it makes MSFT stock a compelling pick to consider. For example, if the regulators/anti-trust authorities have a problem with one of those four companies and an investor sells out of their position, investors are likely to strongly consider moving those funds to Microsoft to maintain their large-cap technology exposure. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe bottom line is that Microsoft is a high quality company that generates massive amounts of cash, has superior shareholder returns and as of right now, is not in the anti-trust cross-hairs. The one drawback for Microsoft stock is its price, shares are expensive and, as I noted the above, the dividend yield is toward the low end of its historical range, which means waiting for a better entry point may be warranted.As of this writing, Brad Kenagy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

276,0.9964,"It's hard to find cheap stocks when the stock markets are near all-time highs. Yesterday, though, the Federal Reserve announced that it cut overnight lending rates. They also announced that they accelerated ending the quantitative tightening two months earlier than scheduled, showing they are committed to sprucing up the economy and the stock markets.This should have sparked a rally. However, in the question-and-answer session, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell did not choose his words carefully. He caused a -1% selloff in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.When something like that happens, I look for cheap stocks to buy. This may turn out to be an opportunity for the bulls. So I stay bullish or add some longs if I need them on the small dip. Even though Powell may have spooked Wall Street, he didn't change the fact that they are still dovish and in a stimulative mode.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 Within that narrative, today we examine three cheap stocks on my list of buys for the next few years: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). GOOGL stock is lagging the S&P 500 by two points, but the other two stocks to buy are up more than the S&P by over 60%. Apple (AAPL)Apple reported earnings yesterday and they beat on all metrics. More importantly, management was bullish about their progress in the &quot;services&quot; area, which is the new buzzword for Wall Street. AAPL stock soared on the headline.Even though the iPhone sales were less-than-ideal, the revenues from services are huge and exceed the sales of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for example.Even though Tim Cook is not known for his innovation, under his leadership Apple stock is rising on something other than the iPhone. This is a good thing even though it might upset a few critics. The company still has a good runway for the next few years regardless of skeptics' opinions.Fundamentally, AAPL stock is still too cheap. It sells at 18 price-to-earnings ratio and pays a 1.5% dividend. Apple stock gets little respect from that perspective. Maybe with the shift in focus away from the iPhone in its evaluation, it will bring about more credit on Wall Street for prices in AAPL stock.In any case, owning Apple shares here makes sense for the long-term. Because if the general markets are higher down the line, then so is AAPL stock. It's the prime example of cheap stocks.In addition to the fundamentals, the AAPL stock technicals are also bullish. There is an ongoing pattern with a target that could send the stock to $250 per share or higher in the next few months. So if I have the stock I stay in it. If not, then I can start a position to capture the move.Owning shares of Apple at these levels is not likely to be a financial debacle. The stock will be higher down the line if one is patient enough. Alphabet (GOOGL)Like AAPL, Alphabet stock also doesn't get the respect it deserves on Wall Street. Even if they have managed to create capital appreciation in the stock price without much financial engineering. The Google cash position is now stronger than that of Apple, which doesn't get much coverage in the media.GOOGL is a company that still dominates all search. It does have significant competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the management team is savvy enough to handle that. Besides, there is enough room for all three to coexist. The digitization and mobile trends are growing exponentially and there will be enough business to go around.In addition to search, Google has many other ventures, most notably the Waymo self-driving company. This will eventually become another cash cow for GOOGL and a large contributor for more upside in Google stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Just like Apple, owning Alphabet stock at these levels is not going to be a financial debacle in the long run. Buying cheap stocks that dominate their verticals is never wrong. Disney (DIS)Disney recently announced their foray into media streaming. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) established the fact that consumers want to consume their media through streaming and DIS is finally jumping on the bandwagon.Disney severed ties with Netflix to create their own competitive platform. They are slated to release it later this year and I definitely want to be long DIS stock when that happens.The subscription pricing is low enough that I bet that the metrics for adoption of this new Disney platform will blow away all estimates. DIS stock, even though it's not an obvious example of cheap stocks, should take a leap higher even from these elevated levels. Wall Street has already adjusted the price level for Disney but I don't think they set it high enough.Disney stock still sells at 16 P/E ratio and it pays 1.2% dividend yield. And just like AAPL and GOOG, this is way too low and doesn't give any credence to the quality of the management teams.DIS is a global company with assets known to everyone. There is not one soul on this planet that doesn't know the House of Mouse. Disney content will be readily available and it's just a matter of them turning on the faucet.AAPL, GOOGL and DIS stocks are proven winners and will continue to lead the stock markets higher. The upside potential in the next few years is much higher than the downside risks.Since we are still in headline-trading mode with a full economic war still raging, I don't take full positions all at once. It is best to take them in tranches and leave room to add later.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Raising prices to boost earnings or to bring in more cash to spend on programming clearly is a risky option.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August That's because boosting U.S. subscriptions by $2 monthly cost the company 126,000 subscribers. For perspective, this is the first decrease in U.S. subscribers for Netflix since 2011. Adding to the woes, the five million new international customers Netflix expected turned into 2.7 million.With analysts expecting domestic subscribers to increase by over 350,000 and NFLX missing its own global adds by 2.3 million, it's no wonder NFLX stock got hammered. And those misses are still weighing on investors.Is there any hope of a better performance in the next quarter? In its Q3 guidance, Netflix says it expects U.S. paid subscribers to &quot;return to more typical growth.&quot; In addition, the company projects an additional seven million new subscribers globally. That reassurance helped make the case for last week's Netflix stock recovery, after the bloodbath immediately following the earnings report. Big Competition AheadOn their own, the Netflix Q2 numbers have been troubling to many investors. But what added gasoline to the bloodbath in Netflix stock was the looming competition.For years, Netflix has been the undisputed king of streaming video. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in the game as well, along with a handful of smaller services. But it hasn't exactly been tough slogging for NFLX. However, the company's success has not gone unnoticed. Starting this fall, tech, communications and entertainment companies will launch a series of high-profile new video streaming services.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is spending big on Apple TV+. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will launch its Disney+ video streaming service in November for just $6.99 per month. Furthermore, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have new video streaming services coming from their WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal divisions, respectively.Making the situation even tougher for NFLX stock? It's not only going to be facing a future where it must compete hard for subscribers, Netflix will go head-to-head against streaming services that will own some of its most popular current content.The two most-watched shows on Netflix (by a wide margin) are The Office and Friends. They will move to the competition. Add the exodus of Disney content including Marvel and Star Wars movies, and Netflix will face a real challenge hanging onto subscribers, let alone adding more. Is NFLX Stock Overvalued?The Q2 earnings report, the pending competition and the loss of critical content all come together into one question: is NFLX stock overvalued?After all, NFLX has increased in value by over 5000% over the past decade, even after the Q2 earnings bloodbath. In comparison, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- which is now a trillion dollar company and firing on all cylinders after years of stumbling -- is up 500% in the same decade. And while MSFT trades at a price-earnings ratio near 28%, Netflix has a sky high 130% P/E ratio.With growth slowing, competition increasing dramatically and Netflix still up 24% on the year, last week's NFLX stock recovery may turn out to be short lived.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

301,0.9912,"(Bloomberg) -- Spotify Technology SA reported slightly slower subscriber growth than investors had hoped for its fiscal second quarter, overshadowing revenue gains and a narrower loss.The music-streaming company ended the most recent quarter with 108 million subscribers to its premium service, a shade below the 108.5 million forecast by analysts and below the midline of Spotify’s internal forecast.“We missed on subs. That’s on us,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on a conference call. He said the shortfall was related to execution, in particular the failure to market a plan for students, and the streaming giant plans to make up the lost ground by year-end.The shares fell as much as 6.1% in New York trading before paring declines, closing down 0.2% to $154.94. The stock has gained 37% this year.Investors have high expectations for Spotify, the world’s largest paid online music service, and have sent shares down after almost all of its earnings reports as a public company. Spotify came in at the higher end of forecasts for most of its financial metrics, including sales and profit.“This company is owned for subscriber beats and while management is likely to sound positive on the call, the subscriber miss is unlikely to be forgiven,” Lynx Equity Strategies analyst Jahanara Nissar wrote in a note.Competition WorriesInvestors have worried competition from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube would slow Spotify’s growth. But Spotify said its subscribers grew 31% compared with a year ago, about double the rate of Apple Music, its closest competitor.Spotify’s overall user base grew to 232 million, above Wall Street projections of about 227 million and the company’s guidance for a range of 222 million to 228 million. Most of those people use the free, advertising-supported version of the service.Barry McCarthy, Spotify’s chief financial officer, at first dismissed the brief downturn before saying investors may have expected a higher number.“There could have been a baked-in whisper number we don’t know about,” McCarthy said. “There are times when investors are looking south instead of north and miss the forest through the trees.”Spotify said it has reached agreement with two of four major record labels regarding licenses. Getting to long-term profitability from the current losses will hinge in a big way on the new royalty arrangements the company is negotiating with major music labels. Music companies collect the majority of Spotify’s monthly sales.Deals RestructuredSpotify restructured the deals such that it can create new tools and services -- new sources of revenue -- that are free from labels’ guaranteed cut of sales. McCarthy described it as an important win.The Stockholm-based company reported a second-quarter loss of 42 cents a share, narrower than the year-earlier loss of $2.20 a share. Analysts expect quarterly losses at least through the third quarter of 2020.Podcasts may help Spotify’s push for profitability. Spotify has redesigned its app to boost listenership of non-music programming, and spent about $400 million to acquire podcasting companies this year. The company has backed the production of original podcasts such as “Jemele Hill Is Unbothered” and “The Two Princes.” Though Apple is the dominant podcasting platform in the U.S., Spotify has increased its share and staked out a leading position in some international territories.Growth outside the U.S. will be key if Spotify is to keep investors happy. The company still relies on North America and Europe for more than half of its customers, while those regions account for less than one-quarter of the global population. “Overall we are still in the growth phase of the business,” Ek said.(Updates with closing share price in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Kamaron Leach and Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, John J.

305,0.9641,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. gave a downbeat fourth-quarter sales forecast, indicating lingering weakness in smartphone demand while consumers wait for devices with the next generation of wireless technology.Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion, the San Diego-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with an average of analysts’ estimates of $5.72 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The forecast projects a decline in sales of 12% to 26% from the period a year earlier.Phone makers have largely given up on releasing new high-end phones based on current technology and consumers are delaying their purchases until the debut of fifth generation, or 5G, cellular services, Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said. That’s making the near-term outlook for phones look “soft,” but only temporarily ahead of an expected surge in demand for new devices, he said.“They’ve all cut and run toward 5G,” Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. Carriers are heavily deploying new network equipment and the forthcoming phones are as slim and light as their 4G predecessors, he said, meaning the market will rapidly accelerate at the beginning of 2020.Qualcomm shares fell about 5% in extended trading after closing at $73.16 in New York. The stock has gained 29% this year, keeping pace with advances by other semiconductor-related shares.Net income rose to $2.1 billion, or $1.75 a share, in the fiscal third quarter, from $1.2 billion, or 81 cents, a year earlier. Earnings were boosted by a one-time payment from Apple to settle their dispute and the resumption of royalty payments. Excluding certain items, profit was 80 cents, compared with an average estimate of 76 cents. Adjusted revenue declined to $4.9 billion from $5.6 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had predicted $5.1 billion in sales.On a conference call, analysts questioned Qualcomm’s confidence that the current period’s shortfall will be reversed once the new networks are in place and the phones are on sale. The company has reduced its prediction for the total size of the market this year by 100 million units. Some analysts said they are concerned the numbers reflect little future growth for the industry regardless of what technology is in the phones.“The market’s saturated now. People buy phones when they break,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “It’s bad all around. It’s going to be a while.’ ’The chipmaker is also still struggling to work through legal challenges that threaten its right to charge royalties on the technology for all phones used on modern networks, Qualcomm’s main source of profit.Qualcomm’s licensing customers are nonetheless continuing to pay licensing fees, Mollenkopf said. The chipmaker is still in dispute with Huawei Technologies Co. over the terms of a new agreement. The Chinese company had been making partial payments, but those will stop as they try to finalize a deal, he said.Huawei, which is not a major customer of Qualcomm’s semiconductor unit, has been pushing heavily to boost its share of the market for smartphone chips in China, Mollenkopf said. Huawei’s increasing presence has cost Qualcomm business among other Chinese device makers that are big users of Qualcomm’s chips.While Qualcomm settled its broad-ranging legal dispute with Apple Inc. and the iPhone maker agreed to resume using its chips, the company lost a U.S. Federal Trade Commission case that alleged unfair business practices. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate patent licenses. Qualcomm is appealing the decision and seeking a stay on Koh’s decision so that it doesn’t have to immediately start those renegotiations.Investors have been waiting to see Qualcomm, in its projected fifth year of revenue declines, parlay its claim of leadership in 5G wireless technology into sales growth. The new services are debuting this year with handsets from Samsung Electronics Co. that will take advantage of the faster downloads and response times offered by the upgraded networks. Most analysts expect wider availability next year.Qualcomm is unique in the chip industry because it gets the bulk its profit from licensing patents that it says cover the fundamentals of all modern phone systems. The majority of the company’s revenue comes from selling chips that run phones and connect them to cellular networks.Growth in the smartphone market has stalled, leading some analysts to conclude that it’s reached a saturation point worldwide. In response, Qualcomm is trying to push wireless technology into new areas such as automobiles, personal computers and everyday devices that connect to the internet.Smartphone shipments declined 2.3% in the second quarter to 333.2 million units, IDC said Wednesday. While the market contraction hit all regions, the slowdown in China “was less severe,” than it has been, the market researcher said.(Updates with comments from analyst in the seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.052,0.874,0.075,1

The Nasdaq Composite plunged 1.19% while the S&P 500 slid by 1.10%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.23% on the final trading day of July.

The July jobs report from the Labor Department is due out Friday before markets open.Let's look at some Dow winners, of which there were not many. An Apple Today …If not for shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gained 2%, it'd be painful to imagine how bad the Dow's losses would be today. The iPhone reported impressive earnings for the June quarter, saying it earned $2.18 a share on revenue of $53.8 billion, ahead of estimates of earnings of $2.10 a share on sales of $53.39 billion.Apple also said up its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $61 billion to $64 billion. In the low end, that's slightly ahead of the $60.98 billion analysts are expecting. Both iPhone and services revenue for the most recently completed quarter missed estimates, but investors appeared more focused on the bullish revenue guidance.&quot;The iPhone accounted for 48.3% of Apple's overall revenue, the first time that it hasn't contributed over half of Apple's sales since 2012,&quot; according to CNBC.In late trading, just two other Dow stocks were in the green, but the gains paled in comparison to Apple and are hardly worth mentioning. Too Many Losers In the Dow TodayAmong the Dow's losers today, and there were plenty to pick from, were all of the index's financial services components, including Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). That was somewhat predictable given the belief that bank stocks benefit from higher interest rates.However, that conventional wisdom was probably dealt a blow last year when the sector struggled amid four rate hikes. Indicating that Wednesday's losses in bank stocks like JPM may be no more than knee-jerk reactions is increasing sentiment that some banks, including JPM, are poised to thrive as rates decline.After all, many of the largest domestic money center banks already warned on net interest margins on second-quarter earnings calls, so that should be baked into these stocks.Familiar face UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slipped 2.32% today. Guess why? There was a Democratic presidential debate last night (another one tonight). I'm not making political commentary here. All viewpoints are welcome, but the fact remains that of the participants in the debate, the ones with better chances to emerge from the crowded field appear to favor some form of Medicare For All, while lower-tier candidates favor a more gradual approach to altering the healthcare system in the U.S.Either way, there's a good chance UnitedHealth makes another appearance here tomorrow. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineWednesday's market action was very much a case of &quot;sell the news.&quot; With plenty of earnings reports still left and Friday's job number loom, near-term catalysts are in play. That could help riskier assets start August on a strong note. Investors looking for sector ideas in the eighth month of the year may want to consider tech and utilities, which historically perform well in August.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

The positive commentary helped push the iPhone maker’s market value briefly above $1 trillion on Wednesday.The tech giant’s results were “good enough for now,” Raymond James said in a note, while Goldman Sachs and Piper Jaffray raised their price targets. However, some analysts aren’t getting excited just yet, waiting instead for the release of Apple’s 5G-enabled phones, which aren’t likely to arrive before 2020.Shares in the iPhone developer rose as much as 6%, the stock’s highest in almost nine months. Apple has regained losses it incurred months back in May, when the company was faced with an antitrust suit and as rising trade tensions weighed on shares.If today’s climb can hold until later in the day, Apple’s market value could rest above $1 trillion depending on the number of outstanding shares the company had at the end of the quarter.READ MORE: Apple Faces Life After IPhone While Still Banking on the IPhoneHere’s what analysts are saying about Apple’s results:Piper Jaffray, Michael OlsonOverweight, raises price target to $243 from $230Apple reported revenue for the June quarter and EPS ahead of the Street. Looking at the remainder of the full-year 2019, expect limited excitement around this year’s iPhone launches.However, as long as other segments continue to perform at or above expectations, this will tide investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones begins to build, which is likely to start happening in the second half of 2019.Goldman Sachs, Rod HallNeutral, raises price target to $191 from $187Wearables drove an in-line earnings print and slightly better-than-expected guidance. Services missed, but there’s signs of China stabilization.Continues to see risk to consensus expectations, suspects that the short-term risk on services is to the downside, but supporting data on this is unlikely to materialize until there is more clarity on iPhone sales in October/November.With Apple exposed to trade newsflow volatility, the stock is fully valued.Raymond James, Chris CasoOutperform, price target $250Despite the absence of incremental downside, doesn’t think this means Apple has yet turned the corner. Continues to expect a weak iPhone cycle through June 2020 and, while expectations are already low, doesn’t see a catalyst until the September 2020 launch of 5G iPhones.Raises 2019 EPS estimate to reflect revenue upside and lower operating expenses versus prior model.Rating reflects view that the iPhone cycle will return to growth. “We have chosen to be early in our call.”Morgan Stanley, Katy HubertyOverweight, price target $247Sees potential for meaningful multiple expansion as new services re-accelerate growth and Apple approaches the launch of 5G iPhones.While other technology companies are reducing growth numbers to reflect difficult comparatives and slowing macro data points, Apple has “already taken its medicine” with China-related estimate cuts in January.Only disappointment was that accelerating App Store growth didn’t flow through to an acceleration in total services growth.Wedbush, Daniel IvesOutperform, price target $235Report to be viewed positively by the Street as many skeptics were looking for weakness on the iPhone front, given the noise coming out of China and the smartphone industry. Bulls were fearing the worst on this front.Overall, would characterize this quarter/guidance as a “major feather in the cap for the bulls,” that should drive the stock to new highs over the coming months.Lynx Equity Strategies, KC RajkumarLynx Equity is “at odds with Street consensus,” citing its thesis that Apple is unlikely to launch 5G iPhone models in 2020. “We continue to believe there is downside to consensus estimate for iPhone revenue in FY19 and FY20.”“While a beat to lowered buy-side expectations may result in a brief pop, we think the stock is headed downward from current levels in the near-term as iPhone build plan estimates for FY20 come down from current estimates.”Wells Fargo, Aaron RakersMarket perform, price target $215“Apple delivered positive results/guide in the face of a challenging macro/geopolitical landscape.” Investors will most notably be focused on iPhone stabilization, improvements in China, continued strength in services, and momentum of the company’s wearable business.“We continue to be cautious on near-term iPhone demand as we think investor sentiment is more notably focused on iPhone expectations into a 5G upgrade cycle” in the second half of 2020.(Updates 3rd paragrah with shares, adds further analyst commentary.)&#92;--With assistance from William Canny and James Cone.To contact the reporters on this story: Kit Rees in London at krees1@bloomberg.net;Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net;Kamaron Leach in New York at kleach6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Paul JarvisFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.079,0.829,0.093,1

377,0.9969,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. generated less than half of its total quarterly revenue from sales of the iPhone for the first time since 2012 -- a sign the company is entering life beyond its flagship product.While Apple reported a record $11.5 billion in sales of services in the fiscal third quarter, and demonstrated strong performances from wearables such as the Apple Watch, it can’t cut loose from its iPhone dependence quite yet. While those two product categories are growing, they’re still tied to the smartphone.All the company’s major services and wearables, including the watch and AirPods headphones, require or work best with the Apple smartphone. Services like the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple News+ and the upcoming game arcade are used mostly with the iPhone.Combined, Apple’s two major independent product lines not attached to the iPhone -- Mac computers and iPads -- made up only 20% of revenue in the fiscal third quarter, despite gains from the period a year ago, the Cupertino, California-based company reported Tuesday. Apple’s also working on a mixed augmented and virtual reality headset for the coming years, but that, too, is likely to be iPhone-reliant.In order for life beyond the iPhone to be successful, Apple will need to keep selling iPhones or make its music, digital pay, video and other services usable and good enough for those on rival mobile devices to switch to Apple’s services. Revenue from the smartphone declined 12% in the quarter from a year earlier, but Apple executives said on a conference call that this year’s effort to rejuvenate sales with discounts, more financing options and trade-in programs is working.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the program in stores is “showing great momentum” and has resulted in five times as many trade-ins as a year ago. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company has seen “strong customer response.”The executives’ optimism extended to the company’s forecast for the current quarter in which the new iPhone models will debut. Apple projected revenue of $61 billion to $64 billion in the period ending in September, topping the average analyst estimate of $61 billion.The forecast helped propel Apple to a gain of as much as 6% Wednesday, the biggest intraday advance since May 1. The stock was trading up 4.9% to $219.05 at 10:01 a.m. in New York. “Apple’s strong non-iPhone sales in 3Q is encouraging to us, as it highlights the company’s progress in diversifying and reducing its reliance on the iconic device,” John Butler, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote after the earnings report. “Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue rose 48% on robust Apple Watch sales.”READ MORE: Here’s what analysts are saying about the resultsCook also expressed continued faith in the company’s music, video and other services, saying annual revenue from the category is on target to hit $50 billion by 2020 -- a goal set out in 2016.Cook was asked if Apple planned to make its services less reliant on its own hardware, but he declined to say so, instead pointing to services purchases on the Apple TV and Apple Music’s availability on the Android mobile operating system. Given upcoming advances in technology, there are possibilities for Apple to eventually make its Watch and AirPods standalone devices untethered from iPhones or more suitable to smartphones from other hardware makers. Still, the company doesn’t appear poised to expand any of its new services to other platforms.While Apple has a large user base, it typically only supports new services on iPhones sold within the past three years. That means the company needs to keep selling devices to customers every few years if they are to subscribe to the latest services.“The iPhone continues to be the core DNA of Apple, and this push toward services and wearables shows the company could go through a metamorphosis, and Wall Street views this quarter as a stepping stone toward that goal,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.(Updates shares in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Ian King and Nancy Moran.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.016,0.878,0.105,1

389,0.9985,"Well, Apple, Inc. (AAPL) has done it again. The company successfully lowered its earnings expectations, and then cleared the lower bar. Apple has been using this strategy all year, to simultaneously manage a challenging business environment, shift emphasis from the flagship smartphone devices to alternate revenue streams, and boost share prices. It’s a tough row to hoe, but Apple’s management has been handling it with aplomb since the start of this year.In yesterday’s fiscal Q3 earnings report, Apple made public EPS of $2.18 and total quarterly revenue of $53.8 billion. These beat the forecasts by 3.8% and 1% respectively. In another upbeat move, the company boosted Q4 revenue guidance to $64 billion from $61 billion. The earnings report was released shortly after trading closed, and Apple shares, which had dipped a half percent during the session, gained 4% in after-hours trading. A Good AppleAfter the earnings release, AAPL shares hold a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is based on 20 buys, 13 holds, and 2 sells set in the past three months. Shares are priced at $208, and the average price target of $215 suggests a 3.35% upside potential. The most recent analyst reviews are decidedly more positive than the average, and indicate that the consensus may be growing more bullish on Apple. What the Analysts ExpectedHeading into earnings season, most analysts agreed with UBS’ Timothy Arcuri. On July 29, Arcuri said that Apple’s earnings were “unlikely to be a material catalyst,” adding that July and August are typically good months to buy in for a strong 3-month return. In line with his mid-term outlook, he set a $235 price target with his AAPL buy rating, suggesting a 12% upside to the stock.From JPMorgan, analyst Samik Chatterjee agreed that Apple has a path upward, and expected the company to beat expectations. Chatterjee did say that there is “upside risk relative to both published estimates and investor expectations, with supply chain checks pointing to improving volume outlook for the iPhone XR and legacy models…” Despite the acknowledged risks, Chatterjee put a $239 target on Apple stock, indicating confidence in a 14% upside. What Apple Gave UsIn the event, Apple’s numbers justified the bulls. Drilling down from the top line, Apple reported total iPhone revenue of $25.99 billion and Services segment revenue of $11.46 billion. The iPhone number accounted for 48.3% of total sales – the first time 2012 that it has been less than half – and it just missed the forecast target, but the quarterly decline was only 4%, as opposed to 12% in Q2. The services number, however, was the best the company has ever reported. Apple CEO Tim Cook said, speaking of the quarter as a whole:&gt; “This was our biggest June quarter ever — driven by all-time record revenue from Services, accelerating growth from Wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends.

409,0.9975,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. shares slid after South Korea’s most important company reported sharply lower profit amid global trade tensions and a wireless industry slump.Net income fell 54% from a year earlier to 5.06 trillion won ($4.3 billion) for the three months ended June, the Suwon, South Korea based company said in a statement, while revenue dropped 4% to 56.1 trillion won. Shares slid as much as 3.3%.The world’s largest maker of memory chips and smartphones has been hammered by geopolitical tensions and a wireless slump. The U.S.-China trade war has rattled the global tech-supply chain and weighed down the price of memory chips used in phones and data centers. In addition, Japan restricted the export of materials used in chips and displays to Korea, raising concern over potential disruptions at Samsung and SK Hynix Inc.Samsung had planned to announce its three-year shareholder return policy Wednesday, but put off the announcement until early next year, citing significant new challenges.“Shares are falling as Samsung delays shareholder return plans because of growing external uncertainties,” Greg Roh, senior vice president at Hyundai Motor Securities, said by phone. “As for now, the extent of global cloud customers’ investments and Japan’s export restrictions are important factors for Samsung’s outlook.”Its stock originally traded higher and then dropped lower during an investor call as Samsung said it’s facing uncertainty due to growing macroeconomic issues. Beyond the U.S.-China dispute, Japan may announce further export curbs against South Korea this week.“Even though Japan’s measures do not ban the export of the materials, we are facing difficulties due to the burden of new export approval process and uncertainties that this new process will bring,” Robert Yi, an investor relations executive, said on an earnings call. “We are dedicated to minimizing any negative impact on our manufacturing process.”Samsung did signal optimism about improvements for the memory business -- its most profitable -- for the rest of the year.“In the second half, demand is expected to grow although the company sees volatility in the overall industry due to increased external uncertainties,” Samsung said in a statement Wednesday. The company said memory demand increased in the second quarter as data-center customers resumed purchasing and mobile applications adopted higher-capacity products. The company didn’t commit to cutting capacity saying that expenditure plans for 2020 haven’t been finalized.Samsung had reported preliminary numbers this month that showed operating profit fell more than 50% and its net income did exceed the 4.88 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Shares have been little changed over the past year, though they’ve gained in recent weeks with hope of a recovery in chip prices and of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute.Memory chips have been challenging this year. Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules, used to store data on PCs and servers, dropped by 25.1% in the June quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for TLC 128 NAND flash memory dropped 11.5%.Demand for DRAM is expected to rise on seasonal factors while servers will benefit as customers adjust inventory levels and resume purchasing, Samsung said in its statement. The NAND market should stabilize from the third quarter, it said.“We will continue to manage line operations flexibly depending on demand changes. Currently, we are not considering any artificial decrease of wafer input,” Chun SeWon, executive vice president of the company’s semiconductor business said during the earnings call.Chipmakers have been predicting a recovery in memory demand this year, but that’s been delayed amid the trade war and slower expansion of data centers. “A demand-driven oversupply in the DRAM market will push pricing down 42.1% in 2019 and the oversupply is expected to extend through the second quarter of 2020,” Gartner Inc. said in a note on July 22.The mobile division of the world’s largest smartphone maker posted a 42% decline in operating income to 1.56 trillion won. Samsung said its profitability eroded because of intensifying competition in low-to-mid range markets, and vowed to launch successfully the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Fold in the second half of this year.Samsung’s display division, which supplies organic light-emitting-diode screens for Apple’s iPhones, posted operating profit of 750 billion won due to a one-time gain and a gradual demand recovery. The consumer electronics unit, which includes TVs and appliances, posted 710 billion won of profit.“There are many negative factors for Samsung, but its display business is improving,” Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities, said before earnings release. “Samsung might start seeing a windfall from the U.S. ban on Huawei and more display orders from Apple.”(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter Elstrom, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.066,0.789,0.145,1
410,0.981,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Citigroup Inc.’s Mike Corbat is under the gun. While most shareholders appreciate what the CEO has done to cut costs and steady the ship, they now want him to narrow the bank’s gap in return on equity with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp.Few could quarrel with that. But selling the Asian retail business, as some have advocated, would defy common sense. That may be one of the suggestions of a dissident group of large investors, analysts and some bank insiders, according to a recent article in the Financial Times titled “Citigroup: pressure builds for strategic shift.” Corbat and the board should say a firm but polite “no.”At first blush, it may appear that the activists have a point. Out of 19 consumer banks Citi operates globally, 17 are part of its Asia business.(1) The consumer franchise in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia has gone nowhere in seven years under Corbat. Revenue, at $7.5 billion revenue last year, was practically unchanged from 2013. When Corbat replaced his crisis-fighting predecessor Vikram Pandit, roughly half of Citi’s net income in Asia came from the consumer bank. Now the institutional clients group – the corporate and investment bank – contributes twice as much.Yet there are other, more important considerations. For one thing, the business isn’t a laggard any more. Citi’s Asia consumer banking profit rose 19% from a year earlier in the June quarter. If the idea is to lift Citi’s 12% return on tangible common equity toward Bank of America’s 16% or JPMorgan’s 20%, it’s difficult to see how that goal would be met by selling a unit that earns as much as 21% on that basis.Going beyond the numbers, the consumer bank is increasingly critical for Citi to defend its global leadership in serving the day-to-day banking needs of multinationals. As I wrote recently, that business brings in $715 billion in low-cost corporate deposits.To offer a suite of services to new-age Asian companies like Grab, which aims to be a “super app” for Southeast Asia, Citi needs the balance sheet and products of its consumer bank – such as credit cards – to be available in countries where the ride-hailing service operates. Paytm, the popular Indian mobile wallet, wants to embed consumer credit into its vanilla payment services, something the firm’s license conditions restrict it from doing alone. A co-branded credit card with Citi would solve the problem for the Berkshire Hathaway Inc.-backed unicorn, which now has 8 million customers in Japan alongside more than 250 million in India.Think of Grab and Paytm as prototypes of the new Asian multinationals. While their services will be consumed digitally, many of their supply-chain partners – cabbies and retail stores, for instance – will remain ensconced in the brick-and-mortar world. Citi needs its consumer bank to be able to lubricate this hybrid supply chain effectively with money and credit. To retreat from retail banking just as Asia’s digital consumption is about to explode would be a strategic blunder. It would hurt the bank’s institutional client franchise. What the bank learns from being embedded in state-of-the-art Asian payment apps such as WeChat Pay and Alipay (over half of Citi’s credit card bills in China are now settled via Alipay) could prepare it to take on the U.S. tech giants as they come with rival products, such as Facebook Inc.’s proposed digital currency, Libra, or Apple Inc.’s credit card with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.It’s imperative that Citi double down on Asia retail for Corbat to achieve – and build on – his goal of a 13.5% return on tangible equity by 2020. Investment in digital technologies is already helping cut costs in the region, with 44% of new credit card and loan business in the second quarter generated online. Activist investors are barking up the wrong tree.     (1) Of the 17,12 are in the Asia-Pacific region. The bank also considers the remaining five in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as part of its consumer banking operations in Asia.To contact the author of this story: Andy Mukherjee at amukherjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

Earn It After an initially rough year, Apple is growing again, and was up by 1% versus this time last year, with overall revenue sitting at $53.8 billion. Phone Home Apple is going out of its way to make sure investors know that Apple knows it has a bit of an iPhone problem. Sales for the iPhone have dropped off in recent years, as more and more consumers are content to hold onto their old phones rather than upgrade every time Apple drops a new model. To try to combat this cooling off, Apple began trade-in programs and offering financing for new iPhones. These efforts, analysts say, helped reduce the decline in iPhone sales to 11% from a 16% drop. Apple also plans to introduce three new iPhones this year, one with a triple-rear camera and two with double-rear cameras, though at more than a $1,000 each analysts aren’t sure they’ll be hot sellers. Apple also remains bullish about its upcoming streaming television service. Private Parts Apple likes to boast about its reputation for privacy, especially as compared to Google or Facebook. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, declaring that “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone”. But now news has broken that, just like with Google Assistants, Apple has contractors listen to recordings captured by Siri. The contractors transcribe a small portion of Siri’s recordings to fine tune the device, but reportedly these recordings often feature sensetive information or couples having sex, because Siri was accidentally activated. -Michael Tedder Photo: REUTERS/SHANNON STAPLETON",0.066,0.876,0.058,-1

448,0.996,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Stealthy or direct price cuts on iPhones have cushioned the blow for Apple Inc. It should go even further if it’s serious about changing its complexion.  Apple continued to take a hit from a smartphone market that has stopped growing, according to the results of its fiscal third quarter ended June 29, which were released after the market closed on Tuesday. Apple said iPhone revenue fell 12%, about as much as analysts had expected, and total company revenue inched up 1%. The company’s forecast for the quarter ending in September mostly implied more of the same. While most of Apple’s tech superstar brethren are posting healthy revenue increases, Apple’s growth is meager and not likely to pep up much. Apple’s share price rose in after-hours trading on Tuesday, most likely because Apple’s revenue forecast is not as bad as analysts had feared. To its credit, Apple has been able to increase revenue from iPhone apps, AirPods headphones, Apple Watches and payments from Google. It helps that Apple keeps releasing fresh versions of these non-iPhone products and introducing entirely new ones.(3) But although sales of Apple’s non-iPhone products and services rose a collective $12.6 billion in the last nine months from a year earlier, that couldn’t offset a $19.1 billion decline in iPhone revenue. The combination of meek growth and climbing spending has also dragged down Apple’s operating profit margin to a 10-year low. There’s now a clear trend of sagging Apple hardware growth. According to a recent analysis by Bernstein Research, the compound annual growth rate of Apple’s hardware businesses from 2015 to this year will be slightly negative. Apple has emphasized the growing number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers in use worldwide, which includes new buyers of Apple gadgets and people obtaining used devices. But it will be tough for that device number to keep growing if new iPhone sales don’t budge much if at all.  Churning out even modest revenue growth and keeping margins steady, then, requires Apple to keep coming up with a steady stream of new or refreshed add-on products — and pitching them convincingly — to people who own iPhones and other Apple devices. One way to kick-start that strategy is to drastically lower iPhone prices and use those fresh gadgets to upsell people on Apple Music, iCloud data storage, video-game subscriptions and ancillary gadgets such as the Apple Watch that tend to be bought by people who own iPhones. Every time someone rings up a new iPhone or ditches a barely functional old model, that’s one more shot for Apple to spur someone to buy more stuff. That’s crass, but it’s what Apple needs now.Apple has already been experimenting with lower-priced iPhones, either overtly or less obviously. Last year, alongside its $1,000-and-up new iPhone models, Apple released the iPhone XR with a lower $750 starting price in the U.S. The XR has become by far the top-selling iPhone model in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. In addition, Apple started offering generous terms for people who are trading in an older iPhone model.(1) Apple also offered discounts in China to counteract iPhone sales struggles there and effectively lowered iPhone prices in some other countries. Those price actions and the iPhone XR introduction most likely prevented an even worse iPhone swoon this year. Taking a cue from the iPhone XR’s success, Apple could be even more aggressive about slashing prices to lean into its future. Google is a dinky smartphone seller compared with Apple, but the company said unit sales of its Pixel smartphone more than doubled year-over-year after it released a version that starts at $400.(2) Apple could still sell the luxury iPhone model for die-hards but freshen that version less often and focus on an even more mass market iPhone in the Pixel price range. The goal isn’t to chase market share; it’s about giving people more reasons to ditch on older phone. To be clear, even cutting iPhone prices drastically may not increase the number of people who own Apple devices sharply. A large share of new iPhones are bought by people who already own one. Someone trading up from a three-year-old iPhone doesn’t change the number of Apple devices in use. But newer models may make people more receptive to buying additional Apple products, signing up for the AppleCare warranty program and responding to nudges to buy new apps or Apple’s growing array of internet subscriptions and services. I’m still not sure that Apple is capable of truly becoming a “services” company and not a hardware seller. Old habits are hard to break. Apple is tethering internet subscriptions like Apple Music and its coming internet video service too closely to Apple devices to make them compelling to people who don’t own an array of Apple gadgets. It’s hard to imagine Apple finding success with an “Apple Prime” — a single payment for an iPhone and other Apple add-ons — until it can shake up its mentality. Steve Jobs was fond of saying that Apple was willing to cannibalize itself. It may be time for Apple to stop trying to preserve its hardware business if wants to become more than a hardware company. (1) Apple's category that includes the Apple Watch and AirPods jumped by 48% in the fiscal third quarter from a year earlier. That's impressive, although Apple has never quantified how many of those ancillary hardware products it sells.(2) Apple's website in the U.S. is offering up to $270 off an iPhone XR, a roughly one-third discount, with a trade-in of a recent iPhone model.(3) The Pixel is also now available from more wireless service companies in the U.S., and those phone companies sell the vast majority of new smartphones in the U.S.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

455,0.9875,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. projected revenue in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling the company is optimistic about potential sales of the new iPhone models set to launch late in the period.Fiscal fourth-quarter sales will be $61 billion to $64 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $61 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple’s projection at the high end is a 1.7% increase from the period a year earlier.The forecast suggests the company anticipates that its next iPhone lineup, which won’t be a major change from the 2017 and 2018 models, and increasing revenue from services will be strong enough to return the company to growth. Apple typically puts its new iPhones on sale toward the end of the fourth quarter.“Investor expectations were pretty low going into the quarter, and the numbers beat in many segments, and the guidance was strong,” said Shannon Cross of Cross Research. “We’re seeing indication of strong product refreshes and launches as we move in to the fall and optimism around China.”Apple reported that sales in the period ended June 29 gained 1% to $53.8 billion from a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates of $53.4 billion.“This was our biggest June quarter ever -- driven by all-time record revenue from Services, accelerating growth from Wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in the statement.Shares jumped about 4% in extended trading after closing at $208.78 Tuesday in New York. The stock has gained 32% this year.Net income was $10 billion, or $2.18 a share, in the fiscal third quarter, compared with $11.5 billion, or $2.34 a share, a year earlier. Analysts estimated $2.10 a share.Apple is struggling with stagnant smartphone demand as people take longer to replace their gadgets and Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. grab market share. The trade war is also denting Chinese economic growth while souring consumers there on American brands.The Cupertino, California-based company made a concerted effort in the first three months of the year to revive disappointing iPhone sales, resorting to discounts, generous trade-in offers and new financing options to lure buyers. Those measures continued the past quarter.Despite holding a glitzy launch event in March previewing four major new services, the company has only managed to roll out one so far, Apple News+, which has not been as successful as the company projected. Cook confirmed on a conference call that a branded credit card will launch in August, as Bloomberg News had reported. Cook also said that thousands of Apple employees have been testing the Apple Card, which is a partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Those services still mostly require the iPhone.Services revenue reached $11.5 billion in the period, a quarterly record, but short of analysts’ estimates of about $11.9 billion.The company earlier this year stopped announcing unit sales for iPhones, Macs, and iPads, but still reports revenue for those devices.IPhone revenue was about $26 billion in the quarter, falling short of analyst projections of $26.5 billion. That’s a strong year-over-year decline from last year’s $29.5 billion.IPads generated sales of $5.02 billion, meeting projections of $5 billion from analysts.Mac revenue was $5.82 billion, topping estimates of $5.4 billion and an increase from last year’s $5.3 billion.The company said it had $5.52 billion in wearables revenue, its category for the Apple Watch, and AirPods and Beats headphones. That’s an increase from $3.7 billion a year ago and topped analyst projections of $4.85 billion.(Updates with comments from analyst in the fourth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.025,0.883,0.091,1

468,0.9721,"In just a few minutes, Apple (AAPL) will get a chance to remind investors why its business is worth nearly $1 trillion.The earnings report comes at a time when Apple is facing headwinds in its iPhone business. The company's latest round of new iPhones is failing to drive year-over-year growth in the important segment. Fortunately, strength in services, wearables, and iPad helped make up for a continued decline in iPhone revenue. In addition, growth beyond iPhone reinforced why the company is more than its smartphone segment.Should you buy Apple stock ahead of the print? Monnes' top analyst Brian White says yes, as he reiterates his Buy rating and $245 price target, which implies nearly 17% upside from current levels. (To watch White's track record, click here)White is forecasting 3Q:FY19 iPhone revenue to fall by 12% YoY to $25.88 billion, the third consecutive quarter of decline. However, while the analyst expects the smartphone market to remain lackluster, he believes the ramp of 5G networks will provide consumers with an excuse to upgrade their smartphone next year.Furthermore, White is forecasting 3Q:FY19 Mac revenue of $5.41 billion (up 3% YoY), iPad sales of $5.17 billion (up 12%) and Wearables, Home & Acc. revenue of $5.06 billion (up 36%).White noted, &quot;We expect Apple’s Services business to remain a bright spot in 3Q:FY19 with sales of $11.79 billion (up 16% YoY). In H2:CY19, a new wave of monetization opportunities in Services is expected to launch, providing users with more reasons to inhabit Planet Apple. Apple News+ launched in March and Apple Card is planned to roll out this summer (U.S.), while Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade this fall. We expect sales in Greater China to remain challenged and experience approximately a 15-20% YoY decrease in 3Q:FY19 (vs. down 22% in 2Q:FY19), the third consecutive quarter of decline.&quot;All in all, Wall Street sizes up AAPL as a ‘Moderate Buy’ stock, as the bulls edge out the cautious on the tech giant. In the last 3 months, AAPL has received 20 bullish ratings versus 13 analysts hedging their bets, and 2 'sell' ratings. That said, AAPL shares have risen about 35% year-to-date, and the consensus price target of $215.75 hints there's limited upside ahead, with the stock fetching $209.

470,0.9794,"(Bloomberg) -- When Apple Inc. launches a new iPhone, that usually means rising revenue. Chances are that won’t happen this year.Apple reports fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday, but all eyes will be on its forecast for the fiscal fourth quarter. That’s when the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is expected to release new versions of its flagship handset.In the halcyon days of the smartphone industry, glitzy iPhone introductions would send Apple fans scurrying to stores to snap up the latest model. Nowadays, people are holding onto their devices for longer and growth has plateaued.The company made a concerted effort in the first three months of the year to revive disappointing iPhone sales, resorting to discounts, generous trade-in offers and new financing options to lure buyers. Those measures continued in the past quarter, including a “buy one, get one free” iPhone XR deal from select carriers that Apple promoted in its stores.Analysts expect Apple revenue to be $61 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, down about 3% from a year earlier. During the same iPhone-launch quarters in 2018 and 2017, revenue climbed 20% and 12%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Apple shares were essentially unchanged at $209.63 at 2:47 p.m. in New York ahead of the results after the market close.The major attraction in this year’s models lies in enhanced cameras: the two high-end models to replace the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max will include three back cameras, up from two, and a successor to the iPhone XR will include a second back camera.Beyond additional cameras, the new iPhone models will look similar to the 2018 versions, which looked like the 2017 iPhone X. Apple is planning a more extensive revamp of the iPhone with an updated design, 5G connectivity, and new augmented reality cameras for 2020, Bloomberg has reported.Apple has started ramping up iPhone production and is preparing suppliers to build between 75 million and 80 million units for the fiscal fourth quarter and the following holiday quarter, Bloomberg News reported last week. Analysts estimate Apple sold 70 million to 80 million new iPhones in the second half of 2018.For its fiscal third quarter, Apple is expected to report revenue of $53.3 billion, in line with a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Analysts see iPhone revenue of about $26.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, down from $29.5 billion in the same quarter of 2018. That will mean the iPhone business represents less than half of Apple’s total revenue in the period -- something that hasn’t happened since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.To some, that may be bad news. But Apple will likely highlight growing wearables sales and rising revenue from digital services. The company is expected to report record services revenue of $11.95 billion in the fiscal third quarter, according to analysts.Wall Street will also be looking for an update from Apple on trade tensions and the supply chain. On Friday, President Donald Trump slammed the brakes on Apple getting a tariff reprieve for its upcoming Mac Pro computer.“Given Apple’s reliance on China for sales and supply chain, we are eager to hear about management’s strategy for navigating the challenges,” said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A.

490,-0.7113,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When Nathan Sheets, chief economist and head of global macroeconomic research at PGIM Fixed Income and this week's guest on Masters in Business, tracks the themes that the firm’s clients express concerns about most often. These days, the leaders are debt and demographics, he said.More specifically, concern is rising over the potential problem Chinese debt might create, as well as how the U.S. government will manage entitlement commitments that will be due in 20 to 30 years. The demographics of both the U.S. and China are not especially attractive, he said; both suffer from low birth rates, and both have an elderly and fast-aging population. In our wide-ranging conversation, Sheets, whose firm manages $776 billion in assets, also mentioned why he believes modern monetary theory is potentially dangerous. Borrowing to spend on infrastructure likely generates a positive return, and he supports deficit spending for that; Japan, for example, borrowed for infrastructure spending, and now has debt that exceeds 200% of gross domestic product – and so far has not experienced any major negative consequences. However, Sheets mentions that taking on the amount of debt that MMT proponents seem to favor could be problematic in the future.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Bloomberg, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Castbox and Stitcher.

495,0.981,"Wall Street is closely watching Apple (AAPL) ahead of its fiscal third-quarter earnings this evening, as investors will be looking to see if the tech giant can show strong quarterly results.That said, the biggest factor behind Apple's quarterly results would be fiscal fourth-quarter guidance, as historically the 4th quarter has been seasonally strong.Before getting more confident on the story, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore would like see if there will be a lull in iPhone sales prior to the release of a 5G iPhone in 2020. Ahead of the print, Seymore reiterates a Hold rating on Apple stock with a $205 price target, which implies a slight downside potential from current levels. (To watch Seymore’s price target, click here)As always, we like to give credit where credit is due. According to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, Seymore has a yearly average return of 27.4% and a 83% success rate. Seymore is ranked 23 out of 5,257 analysts.Although Apple’s Services business has been singled out by many on the Street as key to the company’s continued success, Apple’s iPhones still drive its operating results. Apple recently shifted its iPhone cycle from a 2-year major upgrade cycle to a 3-year major upgrade cycle. This means that the 2020 iPhone will likely be the first iPhone to have 5G. If investors focus on what is expected to be a continued weakness in iPhone sales through September, December, and March, then Apple stock will suffer. However, if the Street looks past this weakness with an eye on the 2020 iPhone, then strong Service growth could help support Apple stock, according to Seymore.For the past quarter, Seymore predicts revenue of $52.6 billion, which would be a decrease of 9% q/q and 1% y/y. Furthermore, the analyst forecasts EPS of $2.04 versus consensus estimates of $2.09. Looking ahead, Seymore expects 4Q revenues of $59.2 billion, which is a 13% increase q/q and a 6% decrease y/y. For the full year of 2019, Seymore forecasts revenue of $254 billion, which would represent a 4% decrease y/y.Overall, Seymore thinks that the potential reward of owning Apple stock is “fairly balanced with the company’s risk profile.” Although Wall Street is a bit more bullish on Apple stock compared to Seymore, it isn’t by much. TipRanks analysis of 35 analyst ratings on Apple stock shows 20 analysts Buying, 13 waiting on the sidelines, and 2 Selling.

506,0.9147,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Venerable oil baron T. Boone Pickens is giving up on oil – sort of. Less than 18 months ago, his fund launched an ETF tracking stocks of companies expected to benefit from any increase in Brent crude oil prices. But soon, BOON – the ticker of the NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF – will be no more. Instead, it will be relaunched as RENW, offering exposure to stocks benefiting from the transition to toward “a low-carbon economy.”BOON’s most obvious problem was that it hadn’t really lived up to its ticker as far as investors are concerned. Underperforming the Brent oil price by about 7 percentage points since launch isn’t catastrophic. Worse perhaps is the fact that the ETF didn’t really partake in last fall’s oil rally (less than half its holdings are classified as “energy” companies). Still, that shielded it somewhat from the subsequent crash, unlike more heavily exposed E&P funds.Move past the symbolism, and there’s a simpler tale here.Not too long ago, the E&P sector had a shortage of oil and a trove of trust. Today, those positions are entirely reversed. Buoyed by the “peak oil” scare of the prior decade, investors funded a drilling spree, including in U.S. tight-oil basins. The result is a languid oil market barely able to rouse itself even when conflict threatens in the Persian Gulf. Return on that investment bled away to bad bets, cost-inflation and, all too often, fattened pay and perks in the c-suite. Meanwhile, Big Tech (among other sectors) competes successfully for investors’ interest. Less than a decade ago, pundits speculated on the meaning of Apple Inc.’s market cap tentatively overtaking Exxon Mobil Corp. to be the biggest in the world. Now, it is just normal that Exxon isn’t even in the top 10 (it is 13th right now).Despite oil prices more than doubling since the trough of early 2016, energy’s weight in the S&P 500 Index has actually slipped further, from more than 6% then to an all-time low of about 4.8% today.Looking at that relationship between energy’s weight and the oil price over the long term reveals a sobering trend for the industry. The chart below divides the annual real Brent oil price by energy’s weighting to provide a ratio that can be thought of like this: How many real dollars per barrel does it take to buy the sector one percentage point in the S&P 500?Before you begin drafting that email, this isn’t intended to say there’s a hard and fast relationship between where oil is trading and where the energy sector’s weighting should settle. The direction of that line is undeniable, however.For most of the two decades leading up to 2000, the relationship was pretty stable, as oil prices fell in real terms from the spike of 1979, and the sector’s relative value drifted down with it. That changed as the supercycle took hold after 1998. Oil equities rallied strongly – the sector more than tripled by mid-2008 – though not as much as the underlying commodity. That makes sense, as cyclical rallies, even daubed with the motto of “peak oil,” aren’t expected to last forever, and cost inflation within the business was becoming quite evident by 2006.The real oil price demanded to support the sector’s place in the index has kicked into overdrive this decade. That is also partly a reflection of the underlying commodity, as rallies since 2014 have faded quickly amid excess supply.But it’s also due to that shortage of trust. Investors have been conditioned to expect energy firms to allocate any windfall from rising oil prices to drilling budgets, M&A or executive pay, with precious little making its way back to shareholders. Also, unlike in the early 2000s, they now worry more about “peak demand” and climate change (hence, RENW’s imminent emergence from BOON’s chrysalis). So it takes a lot of dollars per barrel to persuade them there will be some left over for distributions.That is changing as some companies, particularly at the bigger end of the scale, have adopted strategies prioritizing payouts explicitly. The deficit is large, however. For example, ConocoPhillips has been the exemplar of putting returns over growth in the past few years. However, its stock actually traded down on Tuesday morning after reporting capital expenditure came in about $200 million above expectations in the second quarter – despite twinning that with a $500 million bump to share buybacks.Yet Conoco’s playbook remains sensible. If energy stocks are proving unresponsive to oil then, like Boone Pickens, it’s time for a radical change of approach.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

518,0.9955,"As its July 30 third quarter earnings release approaches, investors are going to be watching Apple Inc. (AAPL) like a hawk. While Q2 revenue dropped 5% year-over-year, the Street is predicting revenue growth to return this quarter. On July 29, five-star analyst, Timothy Arcuri, expressed his confidence in AAPL’s ability to rebound. The UBS analyst maintained his Buy rating while raising his price target from $225 to $235, suggesting 12% upside potential. Is this enough to convince investors that Apple is a Buy? Q3 Expectations According to consensus estimates, AAPL should return to revenue growth in Q3. However, the growth is only expected to be slight. Total revenue could reach $53.4 billion, an increase from $53.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. EPS is expected to be $2.10, down from the year-ago quarter’s $2.34.  Will iPhones Sales Recover?As iPhone sales make up half of its revenue, AAPL needs to narrow the 17% decline it reported in Q2 in order to meet the Street’s expectations. The decrease was largely attributed to declining iPhone sales in China. The phone is also not cheap, with most iPhone users choosing not to upgrade until substantial changes are made. However, Apple is hoping to turn things around with its 5G iPhones that are on track to be released in 2020. After the company settled its legal dispute with Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) in April, it got access to QCOM’s modem chips that will allow AAPL to produce the 5G phones. On July 25, it was announced that AAPL will acquire the majority of Intel Corporation’s (INTC) smartphone modem business to eliminate its dependence on QCOM’s chips.  Arcuri remains unfazed by the iPhone sales decline. “Even if this year is subdued, it only sets up for a stronger 5G cycle in 2020 (at least two models). Apple has traded with the market in the recent weeks, but July/Aug are historically the best months to buy for three-month return,” he said. Another analyst, Samik Chatterjee, reiterated his Buy rating and $239 price target, suggesting 14% upside. “We expect better earnings relative to consensus expectations, led by better revenue (consensus $53.3 bn) predicated on iPhone volume estimate of 37.5 mn units,” he said on July 29.  Does AAPL’s Product Diversification Make Up For Slow iPhone Sales?Some investors believe that Apple’s diverse product offerings will continue to drive growth in spite of slowed iPhone sales. In its second quarter, revenue from the wearables, home and accessories segment was up 30% year-over-year. Specifically, its AirPods, Apple Watch and Beats products sales jumped almost 50% year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook said, “This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch.”Apple is also adding new services to its product pipeline including a TV streaming service, a credit card, a subscription based cloud gaming service and a news subscription service. Its news service was already released in March, while the others should all be launched by Fall 2019. Top financial blogger, Brad Moon, argues, “The plateauing of the actual iPhone is forcing Apple to address a weakness that most anyone outside the analyst community didn't care much about while iPhone sales were going ga-ga: Apple is/was too reliant on a single product. Over the past few years, however, Apple has put more of its focus into improving its current products, widening its services and developing new technologies. Apple now has a stable of offerings that, when lumped together, may eventually boost revenues and profits past where they were at peak iPhone, all while insulating the company from weakness in any one division.”  Some Analyst Still Have DoubtsHowever, some analysts don’t agree that Apple’s wearables and new services will add enough to earnings to make up for the pre-5G iPhone lull.Nomura analyst Jeff Kvaal says, “China gaming recovery has not lifted App Store growth. Our Sensor Tower analysis indicates China gaming growth has recovered from the 2018 freeze on new game approvals, though gaming growth outside China has slowed. We believe App Store growth overall remains 15% to 18%; we model total Services growth similar to consensus of 16% to 17%.” On July 19, he reiterated his Hold rating and $180 price target, indicating 14% downside.

Just witness Samsung Electronics Co.’s bumbling attempt to bring out a foldable device.But as long as the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. keep this up, manufacturers of that “wow factor” technology can make a pretty penny.Sony Corp. just posted operating income that beat estimates by around 30%, largely thanks to the division that makes 3D sensors for smartphone cameras.While the Japanese company is best known for its games, music and movies, it’s the imaging and sensors unit that outshone all others. Earnings for the business shot up 70% from a year earlier, the largest percentage increase for any of the company’s divisions. Back in December, Sony executive Satoshi Yoshihara foreshadowed an increase in output of 3D sensors, a subset of the various image sensors that the company offers. Since then, Huawei has been reported to choose Sony imaging components for both its Honor 20 Pro and Mate P30 handsets. Apple also showed interest in the company’s 3D sensors, according to Bloomberg News. This desperation to be fresh could be a welcome development for Sony. Its games division is looking weaker – the company just trimmed the unit’s full-year sales forecast – so executives will be relying more heavily on smartphone makers. Apple and Huawei may be hoping that augmented reality and 3D give their devices just enough zing to convince folks to part with their money. For now, focusing on sensors could be Sony’s sharpest strategy. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Some even expect Apple to post its third quarterly revenue decline in its fiscal year, which would mark its first three-peat loss since 2001.The company has hit some recent headwinds, including the trade war with China, declining iPhone sales and a lack of enthusiasm for its upcoming streaming service.Yet, in spite of these challenges, Apple stock is up 10% from a year earlier and 33% year to date. Here are four things you should be watching for in its next earnings report: New iPhone CycleThe iPhone is the company's strongest source of revenue. This has caused an issue with investors as iPhone sales have been dropping in recent quarters. In February, the company saw its biggest sales decline in three years. The company's global market share slipped to 16%, largely due to declining sales in China. These problems have been largely outside of Apple's control.   * 10 Companies I'd Love to See Go Public The iPhone is not going to appeal to budget-conscious consumers. And most consumers that already own an iPhone aren't interested in upgrading for only minor improvements. Apple is due to release the next iPhone in September, and on Tuesday investors should learn more information about it. Apple's ServicesTo an extent, Apple accommodated declining iPhone sales with its services business. This includes the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music, the company's cloud services and more. These services accounted for 20% of Apple's revenue during the fiscal second quarter.These services generally do well because any customer who purchases an iPhone, Macbook or iPad automatically receives access to these services and subscriptions.Most recently, the company introduced the new Apple card and the Apple+ streaming service. CEO Tim Cook has indicated that the company plans to launch additional services in the future.  Apple's InvestmentsApple stock generates up to $60 billion in free cash flow and the company continues to invest heavily back into the business. The company plans to $10 billion on data centers over the next five years and it continues to open up new stores across the country. And most recently, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) agreed to sell its smartphone-model business to Apple for $1 billion. This is important because it demonstrates the health of the company not just today but years from now. When the company releases its earnings report, it will be interesting to see what future investments the company plans to make.  Whether Growth Is Weak, Better Than ExpectedRecently, many analysts have adopted a bearish attitude when it comes to the company. So Apple stock prices could rise if the company's earnings report is even slightly better than expected. If the company can beat expectations and raise its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, this could give AAPL stock the boost it needs.As of this writing, Jamie Johnson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Lower rates could weaken the dollar, meaning U.S.-based oil exporters would see profits increase after converting stronger foreign currencies into weaker greenbacks.Worth noting is that Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) finished modestly higher today. Both companies report second-quarter results this Friday.&quot;Exxon and Chevron usually keep earnings news releases and calls with analysts strictly about their quarterly numbers, but investors might be able to gauge their mood toward mergers and acquisitions when talk turns to expanding in the U.S. or their inventories,&quot; according to MarketWatch.Exxon and Chevron are expected to earn 69 cents a share and $1.78, respectively. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineIt's hard to say &quot;don't get too wrapped up in the Fed meeting,&quot; but the advice is worthy nonetheless. After all, guess what happens on Tuesday in addition to Apple earnings? Representatives from the U.S. and China sit down for trade talks in Shanghai.Hopefully, the talks go smoothly and President Donald Trump isn't compelled to vent any frustrations on Twitter. While President Trump is unlikely to impose new tariffs on the world's second-largest economy, it's unlikely that whatever materializes tomorrow in Shanghai will be a &quot;fix all&quot; for the strained trade relationship between the two global heavyweights.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

543,0.8017,"Apple (AAPL, $207.74) hit all-time highs last fall as investors held their collective breath to see whether the iPhone XS and iPhone XR would kickstart stalled iPhone sales.They didn't.Smartphone sales are in decline globally, and Apple is far from immune. On Nov. 1, the company took the step of announcing it would no longer report unit sales of iPhones. Several experts believed it was because iPhone sales were flat or in decline, prompting a decline in Apple stock.Something's changing, and it's not good news for the first American company to hit $1 trillion in market value. In January, Apple reported its first holiday-quarter revenue decline since 2001 on the back of a 15% year-over-year iPhone revenue slide. Sales dipped again in Q2. The company is discounting iPhones in an attempt to boost sales. Adding to investor unease, at the end of June, long-time design chief (and Steve Jobs collaborator) Jony Ive announced he was leaving Apple.The &quot;next iPhone&quot; used to be a reference to other companies with products that had the potential to change the face of technology and send shares soaring to the moon. But now, Apple is in search of its own &quot;next iPhone&quot; to deal with the very real slump in its transformative smartphone.So, what is Apple's next iPhone - or does such a thing even exist? We'll look at current Apple products, as well as other future launches that have a chance of powering AAPL stock over the next decade, to determine whether any of them have the potential to replicate the juggernaut smartphone's success.

584,0.9766,"(Bloomberg) -- Exchange-traded fund investors have about $58 billion riding on Apple Inc. ahead of earnings on Tuesday afternoon.Shares of the iPhone maker are the second-largest aggregate holding across all U.S.-listed ETFs after Microsoft Corp., in which ETFs own $70 billion of stock, according to a recent report from Bank of America Corp. But while 241 funds own the Cupertino, California-based company, exposure is quite concentrated, with five funds accounting for more than half of Apple holdings.It’s a timely reminder that it pays to understand the specifics of a fund’s portfolio. Broader funds have outperformed Apple during the last 12 months, as the company struggles with weak demand for the iPhone and, in January, cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades. Its shares have rallied about 47% since then but are still trading about 10% below October’s record high.However, Bank of America has a positive outlook on Apple ahead of earnings. Strategists led by Mary Ann Bartels favor the $22.3 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, or XLK, which has almost 17% of its assets in Apple, over the $2.5 billion First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund, or FXL, which has only 0.3% of exposure.There’s also a “fairly cyclical pattern to recent relative performance between these ETFs that we believe currently favors XLK,” Bartels wrote in a research note dated July 23.&#92;--With assistance from Tom Lagerman.To contact the reporter on this story: Carolina Wilson in New York City at cwilson166@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, ;Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Catherine Larkin, Rachel EvansFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.022,0.877,0.1,1

593,0.9981,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the distance, the clouds started to look more ominous for some American technology companies in the last few months. But that’s way far off, and the storms might never come. As far as the eye can see, it’s sunny skies for the industry. That is quite a change from just a few months ago, when slowing sales growth, jitters about U.S. trade policies and other concerns walloped tech company share prices.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index dipped 17% in the final three months of 2018. (The broader S&P 500 declined as well, but not by as much.)Tech shares also took a hit in the wake of March quarter earnings this year. Muscular companies such as Google parent company Alphabet Inc. and  Amazon.com Inc. looked vulnerable as the pace of revenue slipped, profits got pinched or both. And investors were sometimes doubtful  about the companies’ explanations. It’s almost hard to remember those problems considering the second-quarter tech earnings season so far. Revenue growth re-accelerated or held strong for many of the American tech superpowers. There was good news for many less-supersized tech companies, too. Even as U.S. regulators and lawmakers study the tech giants for evidence of anti-competitive abuses, smiles have replaced the tech investor anxiety of recent months. In the second quarter, Facebook’s sales growth picked up after a years-long string of slowing growth on a currency-adjusted basis. Amazon and Google also bounced back from disappointing sales paces. Two of the mid-tier internet companies that looked rough around the edges for a while, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. and Twitter Inc., seem to have recovered their footing. Some of the tech companies that went public in the second quarter such as Slack Technologies Inc. and Pinterest Inc., received warm receptions. Computer chipmaker Intel Corp. continues to grapple with continuing U.S. tariffs and a spending pause by some big customers, but it appeared to be on a sounder path.  The mostly sunny tech earnings have so far continued to reverse the stock market drag of seven months ago. This year through Friday, the biggest contributors to gains in the S&P 500 are Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Amazon and Facebook — with Alphabet and Cisco Systems Inc. not far behind, according to Bloomberg data. The Nasdaq 100 hit a high on Friday, marking a 36% upswing from a low point just before Christmas. Not everything is completely fine in the land of technology, of course. The second-quarter numbers from Facebook, Intel and Amazon, for example, would have looked merely passable a year ago. Investors definitely aren’t sold on the business plans for newly public Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. Apple, which reports earnings on Tuesday, will have a hard time outrunning the end of growth for the smartphone industry. A second-quarter  growth stumble at Netflix inc. was swiftly punished by investors, showing that it doesn’t take much for smiles to turn upside down. But mostly, investors are once again choosing to look on the bright side of technology companies, and expectations got turned down a bit. Interest rates heading lower also makes growth assets like tech stocks look more alluring. Even those antitrust investigations, litigation and scolding from powerful lawmakers feel like risks of a storm that may never appear. All the same disquiet is still there, it’s just quieted again. Mostly, the long-term opportunity in technology is simply compelling enough to outweigh the scary part. Economies, labor markets, consumer entertainment, marketing, corporate technology spending and transportation are going through profound and probably permanent shifts that most likely help many of the tech companies.It’s a matter of time and taking advantage of the opportunities. Many of the tech companies such as the big five American tech powers and Netflix are putting their foot on the gas to improve their position, and investors have given them the permission to do so. That helps tech successes breed more success.Investor sentiment and the tech companies’ financial results remain fragile. There are no assurances of anything. But right now, all that potential is making it easy to ignore the rumblings of thunder. To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

608,0.9958,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The winner-take-all phenomenon is well-documented among sports stars, pop singers, fiction authors, actors and hedge-fund managers -- those at the top reap fabulous rewards while everyone else scrapes to get by.It turns out the same hold true in the stock market: Just 1.3% of the world’s public companies account for all the market gains during the past three decades. Outside the U.S., the gains are even more concentrated, with less than 1% of all equities driving all of the net appreciation in share prices.Those numbers come from a new study on equities, and how their gains are distributed. Ardent stock pickers who read the paper might find themselves turned into indexers as a result of what they see.The lead author of the paper, Hendrik Bessembinder of the Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, and the rest of his researchers looked at 62,000 global common stocks from 1990 to 2018, and ranked them on a compounded, total-return basis. That period includes two decade-long market expansions, from 1990 to 2000 and 2009 through 2018, as well as two major market crashes in 2000 and 2008. These periods, encompassing bear and bull cycles, make it less likely that the findings are due to anomalies or one-off events.The data analysis reveals the net gains for equities can be found in a small group of outliers -- and much fewer in number than is commonly thought of by most market participants.  Just five companies -- Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.Com Inc., Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Exxon Mobil Corp. -- accounted for 8.3% of global net wealth creation. It is hard to imagine a greater example of the winner-take-all distribution -- these five companies account for just 0.008% of the total sample set of 62,000 publicly traded companies. Expand that to the top 0.5%, or 306 companies, and they account for 73% of global net wealth creation. The best performing 811 companies (1.33% of the total) accounted for all net global wealth creation.Let’s translate those percentages into dollar amounts: During that 1990-2018 period, those companies accounted for the entire net stock market appreciation of $44.7 trillion, in excess of Treasury returns. Outside the U.S., less than 1% of international equities generated $16 trillion in capital appreciation, also in excess of Treasury returns. Less than half of the stocks in the study -- 23,905 -- had cumulative positive returns. When added to the top gainers, these stocks generated $66.6 trillion of wealth. However, a majority of stocks -- 37,195, or 60.9% -- were net money losers, subtracting a $21.83 trillion from the total. The total gains of winners minus losers netted out to that $44.7 trillion figure.Concentration of stock returns was not the original focus of the research; ironically, the study sought to determine how many stocks managed to outperform bonds over shorter time frames. The discovery of the intense market concentration seems to be a happy accident. The researchers found during shorter periods of time, about 56% of U.S. stocks and 61% of international stocks, underperform one-month U.S. Treasury bills. In any given month, only 43.7% of U.S. stocks, and 39.3% of non-U.S. stocks, outperformed the accumulated returns of one-month Treasury bills over the full sample period of 29 years.(1)We can shrug at that data point: after all, stocks are long-term investments and we really shouldn't care very much about any given month’s returns. It’s the compounding, especially with dividends re-invested, that investors and savers should be thinking about. Still, this was yet another datapoint I found surprising.Another data point is obvious: the longer buy-and-hold investors retained their equities, the greater the outperformance relative to Treasury bills. It is about 1% for any one month on average, about 14% for a year, 95% for a decade and a giant 260% for the 29-year sample period.  This isn’t necessarily all bad news for active investors; some of the data could be encouraging or even useful to stock pickers. One revelation might be that active managers should consider focusing less on being stock pickers, and more on being “stock-unpickers” -- in other words, avoiding the dogs. Identifying the characteristics of those 37,195 long-term money-losers -- what quantitative characteristics do they share that could be screened out -- might be useful. This is a common practice for quants, but the sheer number of money-losing stocks makes one wonder if that approach is being fully exploited. If screens could eliminate some of the long-term losers, it might not only improve returns, but could help to justify fees higher than simple indexing.Others might interpret the study as revealing yet another advantage of indexing: Not only are low costs and beta (market-matching performance) an indexing given, but the research suggests that investors who index broadly may be more likely to hold the rare and outsized winners that drive much of the market gains over time.(1) The authors’ note: “The finding that most stocks underperform US Treasury bills does not contradict the evidence (see, for example, Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton, 2002) that returns to broad stock markets handily outperform returns on Treasury instruments.”To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

630,0.996,"(Bloomberg) -- Dish Network Corp., the hard-bargaining satellite-television company, is embarking on a second act as a major wireless carrier. But even with a cache of prized assets, it faces long-shot odds of pulling it off.The Justice Department opened the door for Dish on Friday when it cleared the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. In doing so, it forced those companies to divest assets that will potentially transform the pay-TV provider into a major competitor.But Dish, controlled by Chairman Charlie Ergen, will still need to spend $20 billion over the next few years to build a nationwide wireless network and make use of the spectrum it owns, according to Roger Entner, a telecom analyst and founder of Recon Analytics LLC. Additional billions will be needed to run the network, set up stores and buy advertising, he said.“If you are spending less than the others, you are usually not closing the gap,” Entner said. “The others are not going to stand by and let Charlie Ergen take away their lunch. So difficult!”Becoming a wireless carrier would be a dramatic makeover for Dish, a company whose very name is synonymous with satellite equipment. Still, others have pulled off similar feats. Apple Inc. was a nobody in the mobile-phone market before 2007. Nintendo Co. was a 19th century maker of playing cards.And Ergen, a longtime card player, likes to gamble. In an interview on Friday, he said that anyone betting against Dish is making a foolish wager. “I’ve been in plenty of card games with guys across from me betting wrong,” he said.But he faces pressures that will make the overhaul challenging. With $14.4 billion in long-term debt at the end of the first quarter, Dish already is highly leveraged and may have trouble raising funds at affordable rates, Entner said.Dish’s existing satellite-TV business, meanwhile, has hemorrhaged subscribers in recent years.Even if Ergen is able to raise the money, competing with giants Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and the new T-Mobile-Sprint will be tough, Entner said. In most countries, only three wireless companies are able to make a profit. In the U.S., No. 4 Sprint has been a financial train wreck, racking up billions of dollars in debt and losses.Dish said on Friday that it won’t need additional funds for at least the next year or so. And it’s already getting offers from prospective financing partners, said Tom Cullen, Dish’s executive vice president overseeing its wireless push.Long WaitConsumer groups have doubts about the endeavor. Public Citizen labeled the Justice Department deal a disaster on Friday, and called out Englewood, Colorado-based Dish in particular for failing to deliver on a long-promised network. Even before the agreement with T-Mobile and Sprint, the satellite company had vowed to turn its wireless airwaves into a network.“Dish is never going to build out a wireless network,” Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen’s Congress Watch Division, said in a statement. “It has been promising the Federal Communications Commission and the Congress for nearly a decade that it would enter the wireless market but has never done so.”What’s more likely is that Dish will ultimately sell its wireless assets to a top-three wireless carrier, analyst Chetan Sharma said in an interview. And that would leave U.S. consumers in the exact situation that the Justice Department sought to avoid: picking among just three options.DOJ RestrictionsAs part of the Justice Department agreement, Dish agreed not to sell some of its spectrum for six years without prior regulatory consent. The company also can’t lease more than 35% its capacity to the top-three providers for six years without regulatory approval.Dish is committed to rolling out a nationwide 5G network that reaches 70% of U.S. population by June of 2023. If the company fails, it owes the government as much as $2.2 billion.“As we enter the wireless business, we will again serve customers by disrupting incumbents and their legacy networks, this time with the nation’s first stand-alone 5G broadband network,” Ergen said in a statement.Underlying that pledge is $5 billion in assets that T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to sell to Dish as a condition of Justice Department approval of their merger.Prepaid BusinessUnder the accord, Dish is buying spectrum, as well as Sprint’s Boost and Virgin prepaid businesses. T-Mobile is also required to provide access to its mobile network for seven years while Dish builds its own 5G network, according to a Justice Department statement.The spectrum purchase is expected to be completed three years after the closing of the acquisition of the prepaid business, Dish said.“The remedies set up Dish as a disruptive force in wireless,” Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a briefing with reporters.While Dish may struggle to build a network on its own, it could fare better if it secures a partner, such as a large technology company, said Tim Farrar, principal at TMF Associates. The terms of the deal with the Justice Department bar an outright change in control.“The key question is whether a new entrant can disrupt the wireless market,” Farrar said. “On its own the answer is no, but if Dish secures a major partner like Amazon, then it becomes more plausible.”To contact the reporters on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.042,0.853,0.105,1

641,0.683,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump rejected Apple Inc.’s bid to avoid tariffs on some computer parts it manufactures in China, saying the company should instead make the components in the U.S.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has asked the Trump administration to exclude key components that make up the forthcoming Mac Pro high-end desktop computer from 25% import tariffs, weeks after planning to relocate production of the line to China from Texas.An Apple spokesman declined to comment, but the company previously said that “final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.”Trump later told reporters “we’ll work it out” and that “I think they’re going to announce they’re going to build a plant in Texas.” Apple hasn’t announced plans to assemble products in Texas but has said it will expand its local headquarters in the state.The new Mac Pro will be manufactured in China, a person familiar with the company’s plans said last month, shifting production of what had been Apple’s only major device assembled in the U.S. Apple’s request for a tariff exemption confirms that plan. The previous design had been built in Texas since 2013, making it the only major Apple product exclusively built in the U.S. The new model was announced in June and will go on sale later this year, starting at $5,999.Apple filed requests for exclusions from the 25% tariff on 15 components or products. There’s an open comment period until Aug. 1 before the administration would consider the requests, and the company has seven days to reply to each comment.The requests have started to draw opposition from the public. An online comment posted by Bill Smith said Apple willingly elected to move production to China knowing that tariffs were in place.“If Apple wishes to avoid tariffs it should continue to manufacture in the U.S.,” Smith wrote. “If it does not want to pass the cost of tariffs onto the consumer, Apple can hold its prices constant.”Separately, Trump has encouraged Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook to move operations from China to the U.S., Larry Kudlow, Trump’s chief economic adviser, told reporters on Friday at the White House.The Mac Pro has historically been one of Apple’s lowest volume computers, and given its already high price point, the tariffs on this particular product shouldn’t have a significant impact on Apple’s bottom line. The company reports earnings on July 30 and company executives are likely to be asked about Apple’s supply chain in light of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.Apple is also seeking duty exclusions on its Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, complementary devices for operating the computer, as well as an accompanying USB cable for charging external mobile devices. Apple earlier had products spared from duties, including the Apple Watch and AirPods, while the iPhone, the company’s core product, hasn’t yet been significantly impacted.Trump slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods last year, launching a trade war over longstanding U.S. allegations of unfair economic practices, including the theft of American intellectual property. After the president threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese goods, Apple said in a letter last month that they would affect nearly all major Apple products and reduce the company’s contribution to the economy. Those additional tariffs haven’t been imposed yet.The administration has previously promised relief if companies can show that parts or products can only be obtained in China, aren’t “strategically important” to Chinese industrial programs or that the duties would cause “severe economic harm.”Apple shares dipped briefly following the tweet and mostly recovered. They were up less than 1% at 10:16 a.m. in New York.(Updates with Trump comment on presence in Texas in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Joshua Gallu in Washington at jgallu@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Mark Niquette in Columbus at mniquette@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.049,0.897,0.054,1

725,0.9895,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Since the U.K. decided more than three years ago to leave the European Union, the nation's savviest investors have succeeded by putting their money where Brexit matters least.Uncertainty about the date of Britain’s departure (now pushed back to Oct. 31) and the terms of the divorce has meant purging the U.K. from their holdings or limiting them to investments traditionally impervious to man-made and natural disasters. Over 38 months, British sterling depreciated 16 percent, the worst shrinkage for any similar period in 8 years. The pound remains the poorest performer in the actively-traded foreign exchange market and inferior to the No. 3 euro.Europe's strongest major economy in the 21st century became a shadow of its former self, reversing two decades preceding the June 23, 2016 referendum when the U.K. outperformed the European Union in growth and investment. London's stock and bond markets similarly languished as laggards to world benchmarks, after beating them consistently in the 20 years prior to the decision to leave the EU, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“If I give myself some credit, I would say that we acted reasonably fast liquidating U.K. shares” in 2016, said Ben Rogoff, whose Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC has been the most consistent winner out of the 212 British global funds with at least 1 billion pounds this year and during the past three years. His team's 114 percent total return (income plus appreciation) was 22 percentage points better than the Dow Jones World Technology Index, mostly because 68% of the fund is invested in the U.S., two-thirds of that in California companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “It's all about the Internet and where do you get exposed to the Internet? The U.S. and China,” Rogoff said last month during an interview at Bloomberg in London.While Rogoff reduced his holdings of three California tech powers during the past year — Cupertino-based Apple Inc., Menlo Park-based Facebook and Santa Clara-based Advanced Micro Devices — he acquired more shares in Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings Ltd., Hangzhou-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo-based Yahoo Japan Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The 46-year-old graduate of St. Catherine's College, Oxford, became the lead manager of the trust in 2006, “and at that time,” he said, “the U.K. weighting might have been 5% to 10%, so if you had already been backing away to the door, it's a lot easier to escape than if you built a career around being an expert in U.K. equities.” Since the Brexit referendum, he said, “There's just been a complete buyers' strike of U.K. equities.”Proof of such disdain comes with the crisis this year at the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, Britain's most-prized investment when it was launched by star money manager Neil Woodford in 2014. The celebrated stock picker became even more prominent with his contrarian bullish stance on Brexit. The fund plummeted 31% during the past two years by holding a combination of large and small U.K. companies and has frozen redemptions indefinitely.“It's symptomatic of a broader problem,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told reporters earlier this month. “Our sense is that the financial-stability risks are increasing.”One U.K. investor who’s successfully resisted the trend away from domestic stocks is Nick Train, who manages Finsbury Growth & Income Trust. It returned 61% the past three years — more than twice the FTSE All-Share Index benchmark — as the most consistent one- and three-year performer among the 129 U.K.-based funds investing mostly in domestic stocks or bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike Woodford, who doubled down on the British economy writ large, Train, a 60-year-old graduate of Queen’s College, Oxford, dramatically increased his holdings in consumer staples. These are the companies that make such essentials as food, beverages and household goods and can resist business cycles because their products always are in demand.Train, who declined to be interviewed, increased the consumer staples weighting relative to the benchmark to 27% from 23% in 2015 and he enhanced his holdings of Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez International Inc., which manufactures and markets packaged food products, and London-based Diageo PLC, the world's largest producer of spirits and beer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That's likely to be a safe bet as no one is counting on the British economy rebounding significantly from near the bottom of the EU while the uncertainty created by Brexit persists. “If you take a long view, then this may well be a great time to be investing in U.K. equity,” said Rogoff. “Thankfully, I don't have to make that binary call because there are very few U.K. companies I'm frankly interested in.”(Corrects location of Tencent Holdings headquarters in fifth paragraph of article published July 16.)&#92;--With assistance from Shin Pei, Richard Dunsford-White, Kateryna Hrynchak and Suzy Waite.To contact the author of this story: Matthew A.

729,0.9592,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Today should be a good news day for AMS AG, the Austrian maker of key components for the facial recognition system in Apple Inc.’s iPhone.It seems finally to be delivering on its repeated promise that a multi-year, $2 billion investment in 3-D sensing technology would ultimately pay off. It forecast third-quarter revenue of between $600 million and $640 million, well above analysts’ $526 million average estimate.Yet the good news came with a sting in the tail. Chief Executive Officer Alexander Everke said AMS was again evaluating the possibility of a bid for Osram Licht AG, after being approached by unidentified “potential financial partners.” The revelation comes just a week after AMS decided not to pursue an offer for the Munich-based lighting maker, which had already agreed a sale to private equity firms Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP. That climbdown from AMS in turn came after re-entering talks it had previously abandoned, and… well you get the idea. It’s flip-flopping in the extreme.Maybe Everke has made the right calls technologically. AMS’s initial struggles stemmed from the disappointing sales of Apple’s iPhone X range of handsets. Now Android handset-makers are following up with more 3-D sensors, boosting orders for AMS’s gear. Operating cash flow and order backlogs are on the increase.But Everke does himself few favors. The former NXP Semiconductors NV executive has made AMS an extremely tough investment case: the stock has consistently had the highest 120-day volatility of any European tech firm over the past three years. The Osram affair is a prime example of the behavior causing this.As a conference call on Tuesday progressed, AMS shares pared earlier gains of as much as 10%. Analysts repeatedly tried and failed to get clarity from Everke and his team on the logic behind any Osram bid, and investor faith in his strategy appeared to wane by the minute. Executives repeatedly parroted a line about any bid target needing to meet AMS’s acquisition criteria, without giving any sense as to whether or how Osram met them. By the time the call ended, the stock was trading just 1.9% higher than Monday’s close.I wrote last week how any bid would require a serious leap of faith from investors.

741,0.9821,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is negotiating to buy Intel Corp.’s struggling cellular modem unit, said a person familiar with the matter.A deal would give Apple key engineering talent and patents that would help it develop new devices to connect to the mobile internet. The Intel assets could be valued at about $1 billion in a transaction, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter was private.An agreement could be reached as soon as this week, though it’s possible talks could break down without a deal, the person said.Representatives for Apple and Intel declined to comment. The negotiations were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.Apple is building its own cellular modems for devices like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch in part to eventually reduce its reliance on buying parts from Qualcomm Inc. or others.Apple’s latest iPhone models currently use modems sourced exclusively from Intel, but the company settled its long-standing royalties lawsuit with Qualcomm in April amid plans to sell 5G iPhones in 2020. Qualcomm’s 5G modems are widely regarded to be superior to those from Intel. However, Apple’s licensing and royalties agreement with Qualcomm ends in six years and Apple appears intent on eventually replacing the Qualcomm parts with modems developed internally.A deal with Intel could be similar to Apple’s agreement to pay Dialog Semiconductor Plc $600 million to take over its power management business, the provider of another key component for Apple’s devices. Intel currently provides modems for Apple’s 4G LTE iPhones.To contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.015,0.872,0.113,1

Since the financial crisis low ten years ago V stock is up a staggering 1,500%, give or take 100% or so. But trends like Visa's shouldn't be taken for granted.Bottom line, all trends like Visa stock's do come to an end. I'm not simply talking about the V stock chart either. Consistent profit and sales beats over the past few years have been the norm for Visa. But taken together, that's worrisome. And considering expectations polled through crowd sourcing outfit Estimize are even higher for Visa to deliver yet again, maybe even more so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether a corrective period or, worse yet, a bear market are the result of an actual earnings disappointment or a perceived quarterly slight from demanding expectations, the risk for holding through a report is increased in Visa right now. And from there, conditions could rightfully get a whole lot worse for Visa stock into the foreseeable future.

And no doubt gains in stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or a name like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are notoriously impressive.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Defensive Stocks For 2019 Still, as expressed above, Visa stock is no slouch either. More concerning, unlike the bull runs in AMZN, AAPL or NFLX, which have included tumultuous corrective periods to challenge even the most fervent bullish investors, V has barely been tested over the past decade.  Click to EnlargeThe closest technical test for Visa bulls was last winter's ubiquitous market correction when shares corrected by 19.62% or 2015's drop of 21% in less than two months' time. And those incidents barely constitute a bear scare which official signals at 20% or more. Bottom line, as well as simply looking at the squiggly price line of Visa stock's monthly price chart, I'd strongly caution all trends do come to an end and sometimes quite abruptly. Visa Stock StrategyGiven the nearly uninterrupted technical run Visa stock has enjoyed and shares now facing some angular trendline channel resistance, as well as a questionable stochastics set-up, taking profits in front of Tuesday night's earnings report makes prudent sense.For those investors looking to pick up long exposure in V, I'd personally wait for a more meaningful correction. And in our estimation, that correction will be one which can simultaneously test the patience of bulls, as well as reintroduce key and nearly forgotten technical supports no stock is immune from.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

768,0.9871,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street sentiment may be starting to turn around for Apple Inc., which won a price target boost at Morgan Stanley less than a week after another firm upgraded the shares.The iPhone maker’s target was raised to $247 from $231 by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who wrote in a note that there is a positive setup for earnings and “low risk” of the company’s guidance for the September quarter missing expectations when it reports results next week.Shares of Apple rose 1.6% on Monday and were on track for their highest close since May.Morgan Stanley’s price target is now the third-highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, and comes after Raymond James last week upgraded the tech giant’s rating to outperform from market perform. The positive sentiment is in contrast to increased bearishness on the stock this year, with a downgrade from Rosenblatt Securities earlier this month marking the highest number of sell ratings the stock has had since at least 1997.“Investor sentiment continues to surprise us as unusually negative,” Huberty wrote in a note to clients, reiterating her overweight rating, with Apple as a top pick into year end. “We believe September quarter consensus estimates imply a low bar.”The June quarter should see services revenue growth increase for the first time since March last year thanks to the App Store’s outperformance, while there are signs the iPhone’s performance in China also improved. Morgan Stanley also noted “multiple” catalysts for the stock into 2020, with services revenue in the second half expected benefit from launches of the Apple Card, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade launches.Beyond this year, Morgan Stanley expects investor focus to shift to the potential for a 5G-enabled iPhone in September 2020, which could spur the beginning of an upgrade cycle for iPhones.The price target hike is another step closer to $253, the highest Morgan Stanley has held for Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

772,0.9914,"Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reports its second quarter of 2019 earnings next week, and investors seem uncertain about whether CMCSA stock is a buy. After climbing as high as $45.20 on Tuesday (an all-time high), Comcast stock lost ground on Wednesday. Then, shares closed up 0.29% on Thursday.Source: Shutterstock The uncertainty is tied to the Comcast earnings call on July 25. Will CMCSA beat expectations? The company has been doing just that in recent quarters, at least in terms of earnings.Investors will also be looking for big numbers on new high-speed internet customers. This will help offset continued bleeding of video subscribers. Further, prospective buyers will seek news on NBCUniversal's planned video streaming service.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Investors Are Looking for in Comcast EarningsWhen Comcast reported its Q1 earnings in April, the company massively beat per-share profitability expectations. The company also added 375,000 high-speed internet customers but lost 121,000 video customers. However, revenue of $26.6 billion (up 17.9% year-over-year) was lower than analysts had expected.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) The news initially negatively impacted Comcast stock, but it ended up closing on a high note. For Q2, investors will carefully watch developments on multiple fronts.Analysts are bullish on CMCSA's profitability prospects, with a consensus earnings-per-share forecast of 75 cents. That's a 15.4% increase over the 65 cents the company reported a year ago.Moreover, analysts will place video-customer numbers under a microscope. Comcast has been bleeding video customers -- a trend that continued last quarter. While adding high-speed internet customers (something else analysts will be watching closely) helps to offset that loss, the company takes a revenue hit because the loss of video customers comes with an accompanying loss in pay-TV subscribers.CMCSA's NBCUniversal division saw its revenue drop 12.5% last quarter, adding to the overall revenue miss for Comcast. Any news on NBCUniversal's forthcoming video-streaming service, expected to launch in Q1 2020 will be of particular interest.NBCUniversal recently paid $500 million for rights to The Office. Unfortunately Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the show will be pulled from the streaming giant in 2021. However, it's expected to be a key draw for gaining subscribers for Comcast, boosting prospects for CMCSA stock.Rival media giant AT&T (NYSE:T) also has big video streaming plans for next spring, including a new WarnerMedia service that just won the rights to Friends. The competition in streaming video is set to explode, starting this fall with high-profile services from Apple (NASAQ:AAPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS). Therefore, any mention of NBCUniversal's plans during the earnings call could have an impact on Comcast stock. Comcast Stock on an Earnings Winning StreakComcast earnings are on a year-long streak in terms of beating analyst expectations. Going back to last July, the consensus EPS forecast was for 61 cents per share, while CMCSA reported 65 cents. That trend continued unbroken and last quarter, Comcast really hit it out of the park. The media giant delivered EPS of 76 cents compared to the consensus target of 66 cents.That performance helped Comcast stock to recover after it spent the first half of 2018 in a protracted slump. At that time, investors worried about cord cutters dropping their cable subscriptions.Since the streak started with last July's Q4 2018 earnings report, Comcast has steadily risen from $34.84 to $45.20 for nearly 30% growth. That set a new all-time high for CMCSA stock in the process. In comparison, AT&T has chalked up growth of just over 6% during the same period. Also, the Nasdaq Composite gained only 4.7%. What Will Happen Next Week?July 25 will be a big day for Comcast. Another earnings beat is a strong possibility and big numbers there could boost CMCSA stock further.But with Comcast stock setting new all-time highs earlier this week, investors will be cautious. Surely, they'll be on the lookout for any sign of future trouble.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Click to EnlargeThe bump looks like a heartbeat on an EKG, a spike of $3.50 per share that came after the Department of Justice uttered the magic words &quot;national security&quot; in defense of what Judge Lucy Koh and the Federal Trade Commission have called an illegal monopoly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a friend of the court brief filed with the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Justice was joined by the Departments of Defense and Energy in arguing that Koh's decision threatens American leadership in a crucial sector of the global economy.The letter is unequivocal: &quot;Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, potentially undermining U.S. leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.&quot;  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Despite the letter, and a column from our own Bret Kenwell calling this &quot;the perfect opportunity to profit from Qualcomm stock,&quot; shares fell steadily after the spike. They opened July 19 at about $74.40, $1.30 per share lower than before the DoJ letter came out. Qualcomm Stock and International TroublesOne reason was a $272 million fine the European Union levied against Qualcomm. This was for blocking a British modem chip maker named Icera, later bought by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and closed, from the 3G baseband chip market a decade ago. Qualcomm calls the fine meritless.It's the second big EU fine in a year for Qualcomm, following a $1.1 billion levy over its treatment of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple settled its legal argument with the San Diego company in May, sending the shares from the mid-50s to the mid-80s within a few days.Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis placed the Justice letter against the EU fine and dropped his rating on Qualcomm.The merit in the Justice Department's argument is nationalistic, not legal. It is a political letter. Questionable Tactics and QualcommQualcomm's tactics of &quot;no license, no chips&quot; have given it monopoly power as mobile operators and others begin spending big on 5G networking gear. Even Apple was forced to back down, seeing that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was too far behind Qualcomm to deliver a competitive design in a timely manner.But Qualcomm does face a potential rival in China's Huawei, called a big winner after Koh's decision . When the Apple case was still alive, in January, Qualcomm had reached an interim patent licensing deal with Huawei.The Koh decision, based on facts Apple gave the Federal Trade Commission, led veteran analyst Rob Enderle to say Huawei will now win the race to 5G, predicting the company will pivot to its own, proprietary designs and come back stronger, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did after its own antitrust fight.The argument is that Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch. The Bottom Line on Qualcomm stockKenwell's argument for Qualcomm stock is based on reading technical charts. Fundamentally he acknowledges the risk in Koh's decision and the European fines.But Qualcomm is now selling for less than four times its annual sales. Its dividend of 62 cents per share, well supported by earnings, represents a yield of 3.33%. That's better than what you get on a 30-year bond. This at a time when Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is selling for over 15 times sales, without a dividend.If Qualcomm loses and must adjust its business practices, it's still going to win a big share of the 5G modem marketplace. If it wins, and the U.S. has now put its thumb on that scale, the stock is cheap.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

777,0.9982,"Many analysts and pundits are saying that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is in trouble, pointing to looming competition from Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the net decline of the company's U.S. subscriber count in the second quarter. But that pullback by NFLX stock in the wake of those has created a very good buying opportunity for long-term investors.Source: Shutterstock There's been a vigorous debate among analysts and pundits about whether and to what extent rivals' new internet video offerings will hurt NFLX stock. I think the stepped-up competition will provide Netflix's results and NFLX stock with a tremendous boost. Heated Competition Looks Like Blessing in DisguiseTo be sure, the reams of hype likely to accompany the rollouts of Disney+ and Apple TV+ will spur even more cord-cutting across America. The publicity will make more viewers aware of the tremendous volume of shows and movies that are now available online, causing a further exodus from cable and satellite services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAn April report by Convergence Research Group predicted that, by the end of this year, 34% of U.S. households would &quot;cut the cord,&quot; that is, give up their cable or satellite subscription.But by providing more content and working hard to publicize their services, Disney and Apple will accelerate that trend in 2020.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Consequently, many more Americans will realize that they can save money -- and still get access to more than enough content -- by cutting the cord.As a result, from 34% at the end of 2019, the percentage of Americans with internet video services will, I believe, roughly double to 68% by the end of 2020.In 2018, there were about 128 million households in the U.S. Rounding that up to 130 million (to account for the passage of roughly two years) and multiplying by 68% yields 88.4 million homes.If NFLX, as the first mover in internet video, can get 90% of those households, it will have 80 million subscribers. Knocking of 10% to account for password-sharing between households leaves us at 72 million. That's well short of Netflix's 90 million U.S. subscriber goal, but it's nearly 20% above the company's slightly more than 60 million subscribers as of the end of Q2.A nearly 20% gain in 18 months should please and pleasantly surprise the owners of Netflix stock while hurting the credibility of bears on NFLX stock who argue that the company has reached a saturation point in the U.S. Assessing Rivals ThreatCan Netflix really boost its subscriber base in the face of new competition?The answer is &quot;definitely&quot; and for a couple of reasons. First, I'd argue that the services from Disney and Apple probably won't really have the same attributes as Netflix. Disney's entertainment service, Disney+, will likely consist primarily of movies and TV shows geared to children and/or fans of action shows. Apple's service looks likely to consist primarily of reruns and movies, with only a few original shows. So Netflix will remain the only highly popular streaming option with a great deal of original content meant to appeal to mainstream adult audiences.Second, the price points of the streaming video services should allow a majority of Americans to afford more than one streaming service. Disney+ will only cost $6.99 per month. AAPL hasn't announced the price of Apple TV+, but it's expected to be well below the $13 cost of a standard Netflix plan.Most Americans are used to paying around $80 at least per month for TV content. So shelling out $20 or $30 per month for multiple streaming services isn't going to give most people sticker shock. Moreover, most of the consumers with the highest disposable income still have cable. As many more higher income Americans cut the cord, they'll definitely be able to afford three or more internet video subscriptions. Real Prize for NFLX StockAs is often the case, many analysts and pundits are getting caught up in the trees instead of focusing on the forest.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now They're focusing on the 126,000 net U.S. subscribers Netflix lost last quarter while ignoring the company's real opportunity to become the first truly worldwide TV service. They made a similar mistakes last year with Snap (NYSE:SNAP), as they focused on the company's small subscriber losses and ignored its huge ad revenue opportunity.Let's say that, in five years, Netflix becomes about twice as popular as Apple worldwide. That's not an unrealistic goal, since Apple's market share in many countries is actually quite low.In 2016, Credit Suisse estimated that there were nearly 600 million Apple users worldwide. If 1.2 billion adults live in households that subscribe to Netflix, and 600 million households pay an average of $10 per month for the service, its revenue would be $72 billion per year.   If its profit comes in at $10 billion, its earnings per share would be $23. A price/earnings ratio of 25 would put Netflix stock's price per share at around $525, versus today's $325. And that doesn't account for likely price increases by 2025 or other forms of revenue that could eventually kick in, like advertising, theme parks, and premium services. Bottom Line on Netflix StockIncreased competition could actually boost Netflix stock by enticing many more Americans to cut the cord. Meanwhile, NFLX stock could increase around 80% over the next five years if the company continues to sign up subscribers around the world. Although NFLX will have to execute well to accomplish that goal, given the company's huge success so far, long-term,speculative investors should make that bet.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any stocks mentioned.

786,0.9974,"Earnings season is in full swing, and Wall Street’s top analysts are getting busy re-evaluating stocks ahead of the quarterly releases. Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is one of these, having just received an upgrade from Raymond James. This upgrade comes in the face of mixed expectations on earnings and the business outlook; and so now let’s take a closer analysis of the tug-of-war between the bears and bulls on AAPL. The Earnings SituationApple-watchers know what to expect in the two key bottom-line numbers – revenues are expected to come in at $53.4 billion, about the same as last year’s Q3, while EPS is projected at $2.10, a 10% drop from a year ago. Apple’s Services segment showed 16% growth last quarter, and is expected to show further growth for fiscal Q3. Apple has been pushing hard to promote established offerings like App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music, while building expectations on new products like Apple Card, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade.The full-court press on Services is part of Apple’s strategy to offset slowing iPhone sales.  The flagship mobile device has been buffeted by a series of demand hits in the past year or so, including: customer complaints about slow modems; the drawn-out legal battle of Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), over modem chips, that was only resolved this past spring; multiple issues in China, including increased competition from Chinese handset makers and the simmering US-Chinese trade tensions.While iPhone made up 63% of Apple’s revenue in the last quarter, management knows that its iconic product is on a downswing and is taking action. In addition to pushing Services, the company is streamlining and promoting its iMac, iPad, and Wearables lines. As CEO Tim Cook said back in January, “If you sort of back up and look at Apple, in our last fiscal year, we had $100 billion of revenue that was not iPhone... And in this last quarter, if you take everything outside of iPhone, it grew at 19 percent.”The main questions for Apple investors approaching the Q3 earnings are, will the boost to non-iPhone revenue streams increase quickly enough to effectively counter the slip in handset sales; and, can iPhone recover sufficiently to hold its market share niche in a maturing smartphone environment? The answers to those questions, especially the second, brings us to the analyst reviews and Apple’s recent upgrade. First, the Bear CasesIn recent days, the analysts have been pulling both ways on AAPL. The bearish case is set forth by Nomura’s Jeffrey Kvaal and Goldman Sachs’ Rod Hall. Looking at the just-finished June quarter, Kvaal says to have “low expectations for the impending iPhone cycle and do not expect Apple's new services to add materially to earnings. However, the company's ecosystem and buyback program remain strong.”Hall takes a similar view, saying that Services boosts in the spring were derived mainly from two successful game launches in China. He writes, “We believe that increased growth in App Store revenues in March/April/May was likely driven by the launches of Perfect World and Game for Peace (PUBG)… we calculate that the persistence of weaker June growth in the September FQ4 would drive another 1.1pp of downside to our Services growth estimate.”While both of these analysts are bearish on AAPL, both have also raised their price targets on the stock. Kvaal sets his at $180, Hall at $187. Both are well below the current trading price. Checking in with the BullsThe bullish news this week for Apple is the ratings upgrade from Raymond James.  Analyst Chris Caso took a forward-looking stance on the stock, basing his upgrade not on this year’s performance but on “the impact of a 5G iPhone product cycle in 2020.”He sees Apple gaining materially from its recent settlement with Qualcomm. While the settlement included a lump-sum payment from Apple to the chipmaker, it also resolved the patent dispute and allowed Apple access to Qualcomm’s high-quality modem chips.  During the course of the dispute, Apple had fallen back on Intel Corporation’s (INTC) chips, and customers had noticed – and complained about – the difference. It’s a hazard of building a niche on a devoted fan base.Expanding on this in his note, Caso said: “Our call may well be early – we expect this year’s iPhone cycle to be the weakest in years, and today may not be the right time to buy ahead of that weakness… But since the near-term market moves are being driven by macro conditions as much as fundamentals, we’ve decided to upgrade now and let our clients decide the best time to execute on our idea.”In line with this general optimism on Apple’s longer-term outlook, Caso upgraded his rating to ‘buy’ and set a $250 price target. His price target, significantly higher than other analysts’, suggests an upside potential of 23% for AAPL shares.Caso is not alone in taking the bull stance on AAPL. Merrill Lynch’s Wamsi Mohan has long maintained a buy rating on the stock, and recently reiterated it, along with this $230 price target. He based his rating on third part sales data showing “F3Q19 App Store revenue is ~$3.9bn (+18% y/y). This represents a slight acceleration from F2Q growth of 17%.” Mohan’s price target is indicative of a 13% upside.Five-star blogger D.M. Martins Research also sees long-term positive trends ahead for Apple. Laying out a detailed bull case, the blogger concludes: “I believe AAPL continues to be a solid investment. In fact, I have recently called it ‘my FAAMG stock for the rest of 2019.’ Justifying my optimism is the company's long-term prospects, which I believe to be promising yet discounted for short-term worries over trade policy and global economic deceleration.“More specifically, I see in the more stable and predictable services revenue growth and the success of new device form factors, including the Watch and other wearable products…” The Bottom LineApple has shown strong growth in the past year, with the 29% share price gains outpacing both the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indexes, but the company has faced dangerous headwinds, too. To a large extent, Apple management has been able to manage the expectations over the past six months, lower the bar, and then beat the lowered expectations, but that strategy may be running its course.The result, as seen above, is mixed reviews. Respected analysts are lining up on both the bull and bear sides for this stock, and there are strong cases made in both directions. The analyst consensus, however, remains bullish on Apple. AAPL shares get a moderate buy rating, based on 20 buys, 14 holds, and 2 sells assigned in the past three months. Shares are trading for $202, so the $215 average price target implies a 6.36% upside potential.Disclosure: This author is long on AAPL.",0.035,0.857,0.109,1

793,0.9392,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc.’s biggest earnings surprise in years sent the shares plummeting the day after results were released, leaving analysts and investors wondering why they were caught so off guard.When some companies know that their quarterly results are going to fall short of forecasts, they put out a pre-announcement or update their guidance. But not Netflix.Instead, the company dropped a bombshell with no warning: Its customer growth was roughly half what it projected, and Netflix actually lost U.S. subscribers during the period. That hasn’t happened since 2011, when the company made a disastrous attempt to split up its streaming and DVD-by-mail operations.The fallout on Thursday included the worst stock rout in three years, with the stock declining 10% to erase more than $16 billion in market value. Shares in Netflix extended those declines on Friday, falling 3.1% to $315.10 per share, their lowest since January. The stock has fallen for seven consecutive sessions, the longest losing streak in nearly four years.“You would think Netflix would want to update guidance or give a pre-annoucement, as I’m sure they definitely knew about this for a while,” said Nick Licouris, an investment adviser at Gerber Kawasaki. “But they probably didn’t want to do it because they were going to take a hit at that time or during earnings -- especially since subscriber numbers are the No. 1 thing analysts look at -- and in earnings you can spin it better than a stand-alone announcement.”Not Necessary?Another reason not to issue a warning: The company met most of Wall Street’s financial estimates, such as sales and profit. It was only the subscriber numbers that really came up short.“Revenue was very close to guidance and profits were actually above, so I’d guess they didn’t think it was necessary to pre-announce a weak sub number when other financial metrics were fine,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.There’s also been a broader shift away from giving earnings warnings, said Huber Research Partners founder Craig Huber.“I have noticed companies in media and internet that I follow do not seem to pre-announce pending negative results with the same regularity as years ago,” he said.Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, didn’t have an immediate comment.The streaming giant’s tight-lipped culture extends beyond earnings. Unlike traditional media companies, it’s very selective about the viewer information it provides. Third parties try to fill the gaps by providing their own data on Netflix’s audience, but that can prove to be unreliable.Third-Party ServicesThose kinds of data services failed to predict the latest shortfall, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker said in a note.“For several days,” she said, “investors told us ‘such-and-such data service suggests domestic adds will come in line; while international might be somewhat soft.’ Wrong. I mean -- right in the sense that international was soft but totally wrong on the domestic subs part.”Netflix remains the dominant paid video streaming service, with its sights set on international expansion to counter slowing growth at home. But rising competition abroad -- such as a U.K. streaming venture announced Friday between ITV Plc and the BBC -- could challenge that growth as well.Netflix also delivers its earnings in an idiosyncratic way. Instead of doing a traditional Q&A conference call, the company releases an “earnings interview” on YouTube with a single analyst. It also issues its reports on its website, not through the paid services that many companies use to disseminate information.Though this week’s stock rout was especially severe, it’s common for Netflix’s earnings to spark a huge share move. The average change on the day after quarterly reports is almost 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Compare that with Apple Inc., where it’s 4.4%. Or Microsoft Corp., where it’s 4.1%.There’s another explanation for the huge swings in Netflix’s stock: overreaction. That was the message from Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings this week. It’s easy to “overinterpret” subscriber figures, he said.“Sometimes we are forecast high, sometimes we forecast low,” he said. “We’re just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can.”(Closes shares in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Morwenna Coniam.To contact the reporters on this story: Kamaron Leach in New York at kleach6@bloomberg.net;Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.063,0.847,0.09,1

801,0.9897,"(Bloomberg) -- Tinder joined a growing backlash against app store taxes by bypassing Google Play in a move that could shake up the billion-dollar industry dominated by Google and Apple Inc.The online dating site launched a new default payment process that skips Google Play and forces users to enter their credit card details straight into Tinder’s app, according to new research by Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter. Once a user has entered their payment information, the app not only remembers it, but also removes the choice to swap back to Google Play for future purchases, he wrote.“This is a huge difference,&quot; Schachter said in an interview. “It’s an incredibly high-margin business for Google bringing in billions of dollars,&quot; he said.The shares of Tinder’s parent company, Match Group Inc., spiked 5% when Schachter’s note was published on Thursday. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. were little changed.Apple and Google launched their app stores in 2008, and they soon grew into powerful marketplaces that matched the creations of millions of independent developers with billions of smartphone users. In exchange, the companies take as much as 30% of revenue. The app economy is expected to grow to $157 billion in 2022, according to App Annie projections.As the market expands, a growing revolt has been gaining steam over the past year. Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission earlier this year, claiming the cut Apple takes amounts to a tax on competitors. Netflix Inc. has recently stopped letting Apple users subscribe via the App Store and Epic Games Inc. said last year it wouldn’t distribute Fortnite, one of the world’s most popular video games, through Google Play.Match declined to answer questions about whether the company was also investigating bypassing Apple’s App Store. Match is expected to discuss the payment flow change with analysts and investors during its next earnings call on Aug. 6.“At Match Group, we constantly test new updates and features to offer convenience, control and choice to our users,&quot; Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Match, wrote in an email. “We will always try to provide options that benefit their experience and offering payment options is one example of this.&quot;Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Of the high-profile companies that have shunned the App store, Match is the only one that has changed the payment method in-app, Schachter noted. Others have instead forced subscribers back to their own websites to enter payment information.Tinder’s move could spark a domino effect.“Tinder is relatively small and it won’t have a massive impact, but the concern is if this grows and gets into gaming apps as it starts moving forward,&quot; Schachter said. “We’re going to see a lot of other companies potentially trying to experiment with this.&quot;&#92;--With assistance from Mark Bergen.To contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.025,0.868,0.108,1

816,0.9625,"As one of the world's premiere chipmakers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) naturally attracts significant attention from market participants. However, this period draws more eyeballs than usual.Source: Shutterstock It's not only about the company's upcoming second quarter of 2019 earnings report. Rather, it's whether the semiconductor firm has finally addressed its challenges to justify taking a shot at Intel stock.Understandably, many investors are not convinced with INTC stock. In Q1, the chipmaker delivered a beat on both per-share profitability and revenue. Ordinarily, such results would spike the Intel stock price. But that's not what happened, primarily due to management disclosing a rather disappointing guidance for the rest of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor one thing, Intel didn't see a &quot;clear path to profitability&quot; in the mobile 5G space. Essentially, this move gave rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) significant leverage in the next-generation telecommunications sector. Just as critically, Intel lost credibility with its core customers. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) desperately hoped that Intel could provide a 5G solution because it has a poor relationship with Qualcomm.Failing your enterprise clients is a surefire way to ruin your reputation. Thus, I can't blame the markets for taking down the Intel stock price a few notches.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Secondly, the competition smells blood. Of course, I'm mostly referring to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). A perpetual runner-up, AMD has finally taken Intel to task for its many errors. Now, AMD has the chipset portfolio to compete with Intel on laptop PCs, data servers and enterprise-level businesses. With the rival bringing attractive pricing and top-notch products to the table, INTC stock appears incredibly troubled. Intel Stock Is an Ideal Contrarian InvestmentNaturally, folks may wonder if they should take the obvious trade: dump INTC stock and get on board AMD (or another upstart rival)? Although the narrative doesn't appear compelling for INTC, I believe that shares offer an ideal contrarian investment.Generally speaking, both the investor and the techie community are heaping the love on AMD. I get it. Most folks love a good underdog story, and AMD is it. Plus, the company has a rabid following that is difficult to explain.If you want to start a verbal tussle, say something negative about AMD. If you want threats to your safety, talk positively about Intel stock in the same breath.But this scenario is ripe for going against the grain. Despite Intel's reputation as an established stalwart, it still has a viable growth narrative. For example, Q4 2006 to Q1 2019, the correlation coefficient between corporate revenue and INTC stock is 87%. Even under a more recent comparison from Q1 2014, the correlation remains strong at 82%.  Click to EnlargeWhat am I saying here? As revenue increases, so too does the Intel stock price. And it's doing so consistently, meaning that this investment is rational: the technicals largely trade on the fundamentals.However, when the price action dips significantly as we saw following the Q1 2019 earnings report, I believe contrarians have an opportunity to profit. Mainly, I think this because the bad news is baked into the Intel stock price.Sure, the company has suffered some embarrassing internal and operational gaffes. But to be perpetually bearish on INTC stock doesn't really make sense. We're talking Intel here. If anything, they have the resources to aggressively reclaim lost ground that other competitors do not have. INTC Stock Remains a PowerhouseAnother factor to consider is that AMD may have matched Intel in terms of chip performance and capabilities. However, that's just one component. As a significantly smaller outfit, AMD doesn't have the bandwidth to take down INTC comprehensively.For instance, look at the PC market. Intel's delays in distributing its 10-nanometer chips have opened the door to AMD to steal segment share. However, AMD is only able to provide the chips themselves.But the PC market is much more than just processors. As the larger company, INTC offers related components to its enterprise clients, such as Wi-Fi chips and NAND flash. It also builds platforms so client manufacturers can maximize the potential of their PC products.In other words, Intel is too deeply embedded within the broader tech market to simply unseat. Therefore, I feel confident that Intel stock can rise from its present (and likely temporary) challenges.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

827,0.9856,"(Bloomberg) -- Sure, I like privacy in the abstract. But I’m applying for an apartment in New York City, and I just sent out my only slightly redacted W-2, credit history and screenshots of my bank account to several people just because they said they’re real estate brokers.So I cannot judge the thousands of Americans who sent in a picture of themselves to a Russian-made smartphone application that they hadn’t heard of the day before. FaceApp is a viral app that allows people to create startlingly realistic images of themselves as seniors or as children. And this week, it incited a panic as reports emerged that people using the app were sending their images to a little-known Russian company for doctoring.The scandal is not surprising. Whether it’s a hip thing like FaceApp (literally all it does is age you)—or the age-old torture of applying for an urban apartment—it doesn’t take much to get any of us to hand over our data.I have no idea whether people should be wary of FaceApp in particular. Security researchers have found no evidence that it sucks up all your photos or does anything similarly nefarious. The company said it deletes most images within 48 hours and that it will remove user data upon request.The fact that it’s Russian isn’t enough to discredit it. But Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for an FBI investigation. And if we were living in a movie, the all-powerful facial recognition machine that brings humanity to its knees would certainly be built on the back of viral human vanity.It’s interesting to look at the FaceApp panic in the context of the broader privacy conversation around Silicon Valley’s tech giants. At Facebook Inc., the company has argued that its size is part of the reason it’s able to safeguard user data better than smaller, less controllable competitors. And compared to any random app, I’m sure Facebook is fairly responsible. (Listen to this podcast for a compelling argument that the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal might have been kind of overblown.)Facebook’s opponents argue that by breaking it up, its various pieces and their competitors would be forced to compete by offering superior privacy protections. But with so many people so willing to trade their data for convenience (or a discount, or an apartment, or a face filter), the invisible hand of the market probably won’t protect us from tech overreach.The most obvious answer is privacy regulation. This is why we elect leaders to create a regulatory state to watch out for us. I’m not particularly interested in investigating the factory farm that pumps out the eggs that I buy. That’s why I rely on the Food and Drug Administration to keep an eye on things.But in the absence of strong government oversight in the internet world, we’ve had to rely on app stores and other log-in tools to protect us. That has some mixed results. And it means the gatekeepers—Apple Inc., Google and Facebook, in particular—know a ton about us.I’m sure some privacy-minded people will object to this sort of defeatism. Yes, people can take some responsibility for their privacy. As in, maybe do some background googling before downloading an app from a company that you’ve never heard of? But more likely, people will just embrace the post-privacy dystopia. If regulators won’t police the most obvious targets, Apple, Google and Facebook (which has even called for regulations!), I guess the Russians can enjoy looking at our smiling, naïve faces.This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter.

The Dow component, up 0.11% today, is expected to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 on revenue of $32.8 billion. Microsoft's report will go a long way in determining the fate of markets on Friday. Big Blue: IBM SurgesShares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) surged 4.59% on more than triple the daily average after the Dow component posted second-quarter net income of $2.5 billion, or $2.81 a share, up from $2.4 billion, or $2.61 a share, last year. Revenue fell to $19.16 billion from $20 billion. Analysts expected IBM to earn $3.08 a share on revenue of $19.17 billion.While revenue dipped and missed expectations, IBM was able to rally thanks to its cloud computing revenue. Revenue for the quarter was $5.65 billion, beating analysts' expectations calling for $5.55 billion.IBM said it still expects to earn at least $13.90 per share this year. Charge ThisShares of American Express (NYSE:AXP) gained 1.03%, good for the second-best performance in the Dow after IBM. The credit card giant ascended to another record high ahead of its earnings report, due out Friday before the opening bell.The company is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $2.94 billion. Shares of American Express are up nearly 36% year-to-date, making the stock one of the Dow's best performers and one of the best-performing names among large-cap financial services names.With that came some unusual put buying in stock today, indicating some traders are bracing for a post-earnings decline or, at the very least, are hedging long stock positions in AXP. Dialing Up 5GApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.14% on some encouraging analyst chatter regarding the company's position in the 5G race.&quot;Apple's near-term iPhone problem is mix,&quot; said Raymond James analyst Chris Caso in a note. &quot;Apple is selling a much larger mix of legacy iPhones than in the past. The reason, in our view, is twofold: higher prices for flagship phones, coupled with the fact that there's virtually nothing a user can do with an iPhone XS that they can't do with a 6s … think the higher bandwidth and improved connectivity of 5G will provide a more compelling upgrade.&quot;Caso upgraded Apple to &quot;outperform&quot; with a $250 price target. Dow Jones Bottom LineWith market participants focusing on earnings, at least for now, some are wondering what the fate of a Federal Reserve rate cut will be. Between better-than-expected earnings and some strong economic data, the Fed may not feel the need to cut borrowing costs this month or anytime soon.On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its regional manufacturing survey registered at 21.8 in June, the best reading this year, and well above estimates calling for a reading of 5. The Fed is, in its own words, data dependent, and the better the data, the less likely a rate cut becomes.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

855,0.991,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. shocked investors by reporting a drop in U.S. customers and much slower growth overseas, raising fears that the streaming giant is losing momentum just as competitors prepare to pounce.The shares plunged 10% to $325.21 at the close in New York, the worst one-day drop in three years, after the company reported a loss of 130,000 customers in the U.S. Netflix blamed higher prices and a weak slate of TV shows. It signed up 2.8 million subscribers internationally in the period, roughly half what the company predicted.“Netflix has a difficult road ahead, with looming competition and the removal of popular content,” said EMarketer Inc. analyst Eric Haggstrom. But a stronger lineup of new shows in the current quarter could help attract former subscribers, he said.The quarter represents the biggest black eye for Netflix since 2011, when the company split its DVD-by-mail business from its streaming business. That move raised prices for its customers, and resulted in the loss of more than 800,000 subscribers in the U.S. The company had planned to call the DVD service Qwikster, but it backpedaled on the plan after investors and customers scoffed at the idea.Netflix said the miss is a one-time blip rather than a long-term problem. The second quarter has typically been its weakest time of year: The company missed its forecast during the period in three of the past four years.Netflix looks to add 7 million subscribers in the current quarter, thanks in part to the return of top shows “Stranger Things” and “Orange Is the New Black.”“Our position is excellent,” Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said during a videoconference call Wednesday. “We’re building amazing capacity for content. Our product has never been in better shape.”Several analysts agreed that the second-quarter disappointment should be only a temporary hiccup for Netflix. Investors should “aggressively buy the stock” on weakness, especially below $325 a share, Loop Capital said.Heavy SpendingFor now, the second-quarter shortfall is renewing investor concern about the company’s heavy program spending and low profitability. Netflix shelled out more than $3 billion on programming in the quarter and another $600 million to market its shows. The company spent $594 million more than it took in and will need to raise money to fund programming.Investors had been forgiving about the spending and the debt -- so long as customers grew at record rates. But the loss of subscribers in the U.S. was the first since the Qwikster debacle, and it suggests Netflix may be running into price resistance or the limits of the addressable domestic market. The company has forecast it can reach as much as 90 million customers in the U.S., compared with 60.1 million currently.Overseas SlowdownInternational results flagged too, with the company missing its own forecast of 4.7 million new subscribers. Europe, Latin America and Asia have been the primary drivers of Netflix’s customer acquisition in recent years, and growth must be sustained if the company is to justify its high valuation.Netflix is introducing a cheaper, mobile-only package in India to attract customers in a big market with price-sensitive customers.Analysts expect the company to have a blockbuster second half because of a heavy release schedule that includes a new season of “The Crown” and movies by directors Martin Scorsese and Michael Bay. Even after the slowdown last quarter, Netflix still thinks it can have its best year of customer growth in 2019.But competition is coming. Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc. plan to introduce streaming services this year, while offerings from Comcast Corp. and AT&T Inc. arrive in 2020. Those services may not steal users from Netflix, but they will make future growth harder, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.Just a Preview?“We saw a preview of next year with this quarter,” Pachter said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Next year, they’ll have a couple quarters where they’ll lose subscribers.”Another challenge: Competitors are taking back rights to programs that have been popular on Netflix, including “Friends” and “The Office,” to use for their own services. That will force Netflix to rely even more on its original productions.Those efforts have largely been successful. Its shows just earned 117 nominations for the 2019 Emmy awards. But reruns of old shows still constitute the majority of viewing.The slowdown in users overshadowed the company’s quarterly financial results. Earnings for the second quarter fell to 60 cents a share, but beat analysts’ estimates of 56 cents. Sales grew 26% to $4.92 billion, compared with projections of $4.93 billion.The stock had been up 35% for the year at the close of regular trading, nearly double the gain of the S&P 500. The decline spread to related stocks such as Roku Inc., which makes set-top boxes that deliver the streaming service. Its shares fell as much as 2.5%, but closed little changed.(Updates with closing prices)To contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.07,0.821,0.109,1

858,0.9867,"Hardware becoming software is one of the key trends of this decade. As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) prepares to refresh its product line for the fall of 2019, it is selling its software as a lifestyle.Source: Shutterstock The key product launch investors need to consider is the Apple Card, the company's entry into finance.While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) wants to create its own money and replace the current Visa (NYSE:V)-dominated payment infrastructure with something cheaper, Apple Card is a gloss on MasterCard (NYSE:MA), with personal finance delivered through an app and integration with existing wireless payment technology.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple is also throwing money at original content, hoping to overwhelm Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) in podcasts and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in streaming entertainment.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Apple's strategy is coming into focus. It's a lifestyle and an indenture. It's a walled garden where, in exchange for promises of privacy, Apple controls everything you have, including your cash flow. The Biggest iOS LaunchApple's biggest product launch is now going through its final beta test, iOS 12.4 beta 7.  Its successor, iOS 13, was announced at the June Worldwide Developer's Conference.The key new feature supported by 12.4 is the Apple Card, on which Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates it has spent nearly $275 million, transforming itself from an investment bank into a consumer bank. The card itself is designed around the app, with daily cash rewards and full integration with the Apple Wallet to track spending.The card is thus meant to change behavior, which now favors physical debit cards for most transactions. The potential bonanza here is enormous. People who pay off their cards spend an average of $1,154 with them each month, and the average user carries $6,354 of credit card debt. Goldman expects to offer $1,000 in credit to those with credit scores as low as 600, and charge Apple Card customers interest rates of 13%-24% on balances. Apple's Ho-Hum HardwareWith the next iPhone already being called a clunker, Apple has to extract more from software and services to maintain last year's 15% growth rate, with 22% of revenue hitting the net income line.The iPhone 11 design itself looks like a greatest hits album from previous iterations. Its main improvement is a bigger battery. The same is true for the latest MacBook, which only received minor tweaks on existing designs.But the hardware is the center of a software ecosystem that brings Apple profit from every corner of a customer's life. Software and services are more profitable than hardware.This extends to the Apple Watch. Given how many stores had the watch at clearance prices this month, including the Apple Watch 4, an Apple Watch 5 can't be far off. But the hardware isn't likely to change much. It will just be capable of running more software, especially health software. Health will follow cash into the Apple profit column.Critics worry the emphasis on service revenue will compromise the user experience. But people who believe in Apple tend to go all-in. The most important point about the iPhone's market share is its stability. They have half of the U.S. market and over one-fifth of the global market. The Bottom LineAn Android is a phone, a utility that offers unlimited choice. An iPhone is a lover, seducing and then demanding increasing loyalty.Once you're in the Apple ecosystem, the company wants to make it a lifestyle, handling your money, your entertainment, even your health.That's CEO Tim Cook's bet, that Apple products can be more than phones or watches or PCs, but a lifestyle for those seduced by its design and brand promise.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Chips are found in every electronic gadget from your phone to your tablets and laptops to televisions and your car or Uber (NYSE:UBER) vehicles. Needless to say, semiconductors are a big market.Source: Shutterstock But it is a market which has many major and minor companies that start from mining operations for raw materials to foundries for the building blocks of chips to various chips themselves. And it continues to the companies that take the chips to build and sell or use the chips in their products and services. This means semiconductor ETFs are an ideal way to play the sector.For investors, there are many, many themes and market strategies for the chips market which can be both bearish and bullish for any given time period. This just increases the need for semiconductor ETFs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Food Stocks to Buy for Fast and Big Profits Right now, chips are being touted as part of major market developments. It starts with the 5G wireless buildout and rollout. From the data centers to communications networks and all the way through to antennas and devices -- 5G is upping demand for all sorts of chips and related semiconductor materials.Then we have the rapidly developing market for artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) that have great promise for many areas from healthcare to education and manufacturing and even marketing.And new devices keep coming from all corners of the globe from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -even if they don't do any of the heavy lifting in engineering their branded products. And the list goes further including my favorite Samsung electronics (which I have in my Niche Investments section of my model portfolios in Profitable Investing.)And from the gaming to the ever-hyped cryptocurrency mining operations -- graphics processing units (GPUs) remain highly in demand bringing another wave of chips in demand as well.Chips have been on a good run in the stock market. For over the past trailing five years, the industry leaders as tracked by the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index have generated a return of 154.69% compared to the S&P 500 Index's return of 69.43%. Chips vs StocksSo, chips are a bigger business than the rest of the broader stock market. This should get your attention and peak your interest in semiconductor ETFs.But at the moment, trade tensions are weighing on many of the leading companies doing the heavy lifting in semiconductors and chips. U.S.-China tensions and trade restrictions on components and products are causing sales headaches beyond just those two nations. And a major trade problem between South Korea and Japan is directly impacting semiconductor material sourcing.That said, if you want to cash in on the ongoing market, stay with the U.S.-centric ETF market. This means that there are two semiconductor ETFs to focus upon. Two U.S. Semiconductor ETFs to BuyThe first is the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX). It tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index and does a pretty good job of it with a return over the past five years of 154.06%, compared to the SOX Index return of 160.82%.Some of the variance comes from the expense ratio of 0.47% which is a bit high in my book for such an index-tracking ETF.The second ETF is the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH). This ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor Index. Not surprisingly, the SMH ETF closer tracks its index with the five-year return running at 148.10% compared to the underlying index return of 147.38%.This closer return result is perhaps also due to the underlying cheaper expense ratio of 0.35%. An Alternative Semiconductor ETFInstead of focusing solely on semiconductor ETFs -- another alternative would be to focus on the broader information technology companies. This would provide exposure to semiconductor-related companies as well as software, services and related hardware -- all of which depend on semiconductors in some capacity. This is my approach as I recommend the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).The return of the Vanguard ETF for the past five years has been 139.61%. And 16.42% of the fund is allocated toward semiconductors. It has a geographic allocation of 96.89% to U.S. companies with minor weightings to Ireland where U.S. companies domicile for tax purposes as well as to Israel.The Vanguard ETF actually out-returns the underlying MSCI Index over the trailing five years and runs quite lean with an expense ratio of a mere 0.10%.Now that I've presented my way to invest in the semiconductor technology space with ETF's, perhaps you might like to see more of my market research and recommendations for further safer growth and bigger reliable income.

864,0.9905,"I get the case for Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as a business. The concern -- or one of the big concerns, anyway -- is the ROKU stock price.Source: Shutterstock ROKU stock has risen 260% in 2019 alone. It's added some $9 billion in market value over that period. To be sure, ROKU had crashed at the end of 2018, and likely was too cheap at those lows. Still, the gains are close to staggering: none of the 720 stocks with a market cap over $10 billion have outperformed ROKU stock so far this year.Again, there is a bull case here. In fact, I've made that bull case. I also argued last month, with the ROKU stock price over $100, that the rally had gone too far. For a moment, that call looked prescient, as the stock promptly fell over 10%. But a more confident market has bid ROKU back up to an all-time high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAhead of earnings, coming on August 7, those highs look too high. There's value here. But to even stay at these levels, Roku will have to answer some key questions.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now So much success is priced in at this point that it seems difficult to get too excited. Of course, I -- and other skeptics -- have said that before. Can the ROKU Stock Price Hold the Valuation?On its face, ROKU looks expensive. The company is guiding for over $1 billion in revenue this year -- which suggests something around a 11x+ EV/revenue multiple, backing out some $285 million in cash.Of course, in this market, 11x sales -- even for an unprofitable company -- isn't all that extreme. Whether it's Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) or MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), growth stock investors have become accustomed to paying those types of multiples. Even streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), accounting for its post-earnings decline on Wednesday, trades at 9.4x EV/revenue, based on 2019 analyst estimates, with slower growth.But, as I've written before, it's important to remember a key aspect of Roku's business. The company's player business -- the actual sales of Roku hardware -- is unprofitable. Players generated gross profit of just $7 million in the first quarter, for example. It's the platform revenue from advertising, the Roku Channel, etc., for which investors are paying.That revenue is guided to two-thirds of this year's total. That in turn means investors are paying roughly 17x platform revenue -- one of the highest multiples in the entire market. It's difficult to see that moving any higher -- and there are reasons to think it might move lower. Will Netflix and YouTube Play Ball?That multiple might seem acceptable given Roku's key position in the growth of streaming. But the problem is that Roku isn't monetizing that position all that well.Notably, per the Roku 10-K, Netflix and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube account &quot;for a majority&quot; of hours streamed on Roku devices. Roku does not get &quot;material revenue&quot; from YouTube, however, and still appears to receive few dollars from Netflix.That might not be a terrible thing in terms of growth. The lack of dollars from those streaming giants means that new streaming services from Disney (NYSE:DIS), AT&T's (NYSE:T) WarnerMedia, and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) subsidiary NBCUniversal all can provide catalysts to revenue and profits.But from a long-term perspective, it's hard to see how ROKU stock is a clear and easy play on streaming when it's not making money from the industry's two biggest players (at least for now). And it's difficult to see why Disney or WarnerMedia would pay Roku when they're competing against Netflix and YouTube. Who Buys Roku?These questions are largely moot if Roku gets acquired. Rumors have swirled since even before the company's IPO. At this point, Roku clearly has out-competed Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in terms of streaming devices. As such, it would make sense that some company might want to acquire it as an entry into the streaming ecosystem -- or a way to profit from it.The problem at this point is: who? If anyone involved in streaming acquires Roku, it then owns a gateway for cord-cutters. But so many other companies are involved in streaming, that the new Roku owner instantly would own the distribution mechanism for its competitors.That's a sticky situation. It makes streaming providers more hesitant to deal with Roku; they might instead turn to Amazon, who is having some success licensing its Fire technology to television manufacturers. It puts Roku, at this point a subsidiary of a larger player, in an awkward position.Meanwhile, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all have their own hardware (Apple's platform is on the way). Disney and NBCUniversal won't be looking to provide streaming services for their competitors. Smaller media companies, at this point, might be too small given Roku's about $12 billion enterprise value.It's easy to assume that Roku will be bought out. But the same assumptions were made about TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO). These aren't the same situations, of course, but the names of potential Roku buyers being floated around don't make all that much sense -- at least not yet. Be Careful Ahead of EarningsParticularly with Netflix's post-earnings flameout, ROKU stock simply looks dangerous here. Valuation is a question mark. Competition remains intense. An acquisition is far from guaranteed.And, as we've seen with Netflix, streaming growth isn't quite as linear as some would like to believe. For ROKU, so much success is priced in that anything short of a blowout quarter next month is going to be a problem. There's a wonderful business here, to be sure. It just might not be quite as wonderful as the ROKU stock price suggests at the moment.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

865,0.9957,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has been volatile over the past few months. QCOM stock went from $57 in mid-April to almost $90 by the end of the month. By mid-May -- one month after Qualcomm stock rocketed higher -- the shares were back down to $65.Source: Shutterstock Holy moly, that's a lot of volatility for a name that many own for income. Some income investors can ignore that kind of noise and use it to their advantage. That is, they can reap the reward of the gains of QCOM stock, yet smile when it declines, knowing that their reinvested dividends are buying more shares of QCOM stock.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now But QCOM stock looks like a tough dividend stock to stomach. After all, Qualcomm stock is  bouncing around more than high-octane growth names like Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), with the latter name recently hitting new, all-time highs. The bottom line is that there are far less volatile names with yields similar to that of QCOM stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the charts indicate that Qualcomm stock could be presenting investors with the perfect buying opportunity. Let's take a closer look. Trading QCOM Stock  Click to EnlargeQCOM is sitting right above its uptrend support, depicted by the upward-sloping blue line. However, on Tuesday QCOM stock importantly closed over its short-term downtrend resistance (depicted by the downward sloping blue line with the number &quot;2&quot; above it. ). A similar pattern has played out for a longer period of time, with the purple lines highlighting the wedge.So what does all this mean?That data alone isn't necessarily enough to convince investors to go long QCOM stock, but have a closer look; Qualcomm stock is staying above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages.The most attractive part of the setup, though, is the fact that QCOM is so close to its uptrend support and those moving averages. That puts buyers in a low-risk trading situation. Since it's easy for them to pull the plug on the trade and sell their position on a slight breakdown, they can avoid the pain of a major reversal. The only caveat is that QCOM can't be too volatile.With their downside limited, traders can look to ride QCOM stock up to its monthly high near $80.76.  Click to EnlargeFor longer term investors, this trade setup may not be applicable. However, for them,  another trade may be worthwhile. Specifically, it's pretty clear what a vital level $65 is for QCOM stock. While it seems unlikely that the tech giant would pull back and test that area, remember that it did so just last month.An unfavorable development involving Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the DoJ or any number of catalysts can negatively impact Qualcomm stock. Keep the $65 level in mind on any deep pullbacks. Weighing Qualcomm StockRecently, I asked whether  being long Qualcomm stock was worth the risk. In its settlement with Apple, Qualcomm was paid at least $4.5 billion and agreed to a six-year licensing deal. Further, all legal disputes between the two companies were dropped, clearing a huge headwind for QCOM stock and making one of the world's richest firms its customer.The bulls didn't get to enjoy  their spoils for long, though.The FTC made a huge fuss about Qualcomm, arguing that its practices are anti-competitive. Judge Lucy Koh ruled that QCOM is a monopoly and must change the way it does business. The FTC also accused QCOM of charging excessive licensing fees for its technology and has forced the company to submit annual compliance reports for the next seven years to the agency.On Wednesday, QCOM stock rose slightly as the DoJ reportedly sought to delay the enforcement of the antitrust ruling. The Justice Department argued that the ruling would force the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to suffer intolerable supply disruptions. The DoJ also says that QCOM will likely win its appeal.At the end of the day, the legal issues facing QCOM create both opportunity and risk.While analysts, on average, only expect  QCOM's earnings to increase an anemic 2.7% this year, investors are banking on forecasts of 35% growth next year.I like the way QCOM stock has set up on the chart, but I am also aware of its legal risks.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

868,0.9985,"Every day I scan through hundreds (if not thousands) of charts -- and there's one about interest rates I feel is imperative to share with you today.In fact, this data caught my eye so strongly that I sent it to my CEO, Brian Hunt, in the middle of the night!The next day we had lunch and Brian told me that he moved over $350,000 into the stock market after looking at the chart I sent. Naturally I laughed and assumed he was joking. But, he wasn't.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is a man who has lived and breathed the stock market for the last 20 years. This is not some amateur investor who is new to the game. I found it fascinating that this one chart was enough to motivate Brian to push a large sum of money into the market. But then again, I should not be surprised because I also have been busy buying stocks since that chart popped up on my screen!My research is broader than many analysts. If you're familiar with my methods, you know I love to travel and put my boots on the ground for face-to-face conversations with company leaders, industry experts, consumers, suppliers or anything else that gives me an edge. I also subscribe to multiple data services so I can sift through the numbers in search of the next great stocks to buy -- and this particular one comes to us from LPL Financial:It shows every time since 1980 that the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates when the S&P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high.That's the situation we're likely to be in soon. And historically, this has occurred 17 times in 39 years. In all 17 instances, the S&P 500 was higher one year later. Even more impressive was the average gain of 15% in the year after the Fed cut rates.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now If you are not yet sold after seeing that chart, here is another…Fundstrat looked at instances when the Fed cut interest rates during an expansionary period for the U.S. economy, going back to 1971. Every single time, the market was higher three, six, nine, and 12 months later. And the returns were impressive:One year later, the average gain was 16.5%. A 16.5% return from today would push the S&P 500 above 3,500!For context, the average 12-month return for the S&P over the last 50 years is about 8%. So, in this particular situation of a Fed rate cut near market highs, we see nearly twice the average returns.I'll be covering this phenomenon in my investment services… but this is so important that I decided to go ahead and share it now. If there is ever a time to be in the market, finding stocks to buy -- it is now!Another thing to keep in mind is that the S&P 500 is already sitting near an all-time high -- and the rate cut is highly likely to happen soon. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the probability of a 25 basis point cut to interest rates by mid-September is 95.6%. Both Citigroup and JPMorgan are predicting a 25 basis point rate cut here in July -- and Morgan Stanley and UBS are going even further. They expect a rate cut of 50 basis points in July.Now, while a one-year gain of 16.5% is impressive for the S&P 500… I believe that if this historical trend holds, then certain investment themes will greatly outperform:The emergence of 5G. The introduction of self-driving vehicles, powered by next-generation batteries. The continuation of one of the biggest investment opportunities of a generation -- cannabis. Don't forget about the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and gene therapy, as well.These high-growth megatrends are set to continue their dominance -- and the winners will see gains several times more than the overall market. Why I Like Penny Pot Stocks NowWe might be near all-time highs now. But here's the good news: Many attractive stocks are both undervalued and still in &quot;penny stock&quot; territory.Penny stocks often get a bad rap. But they are actually critical to the global marketplace. The world NEEDS tiny companies -- just as much as bigger ones. They're the job creators. The innovators.And as an investor, if you're looking for the next Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this is where you'll find it.You just want to be VERY choosy about which ones you buy.That's what I designed my Cannabis Cash Calendar system to do specifically for marijuana IPOs.Legalization is still working its way across the country (and the world), which means that for most successful companies, their biggest gains are yet to come. Oftentimes, you can buy tomorrow's leaders for just pennies a share, or maybe a few dollars.I'l be releasing my next Cannabis Cash Calendar recommendation soon.

877,0.9801,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has reached an inflection point. After losing over one-fourth of its value during the spring, Square stock has now recovered to its February highs.Source: Shutterstock This leaves traders wondering where SQ goes next. The increasing influence of Square could eventually make the company one of the biggest in tech. Consequently, this growth has taken the company to high valuations.While this portends well for the future of the company, whether to buy SQ stock at these levels remains unclear.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now  Square Is the Next Tech GiantSquare is so much more than a competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Long term, SQ stock will become the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of finance. It has begun to follow in Amazon's footsteps by becoming both a conglomerate and an ecosystem, and ultimately, a disruptor.The company started by enabling every smartphone owner to accept credit cards. It has since moved into point-of-sale systems and can now handle other business functions such as payroll, funding, and marketing. It has also enabled website creation through its purchase of Weebly. Late last year, Square even made a second attempt to become a bank. This approval would allow them to accept deposits.All this will combine into the same ecosystem, one that could do to many industries what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did to video stores and cable television. If nothing else, it makes Square's point-of-sale system a more compelling offering than the ones built by a company such as NCR (NYSE:NCR).The increasingly cashless society also plays into the firm's plans well. Square's Cash App serves the same function as banks from a consumer standpoint. This could leave investors and consumers may question the future need for a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or a Citigroup (NYSE:C). While I believe it is too early to predict the destruction of large banks, it could force radical changes to their business models to survive.Consequently, the question as to whether to buy SQ stock has become one of when and not if to buy. Like other disruptors, SQ trades at a high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Analysts forecast average annual profit growth at 46.1% for the foreseeable future. Hence, the company can attract investors even with its forward PE of around 73. The Charts on Square StockWithout fundamentals, analysts will evaluate Square based on charts and momentum. SQ happens to trade at a critical level. At around $82 per share, Square stock trades almost 20% below its all-time high of $101.15 per share. It has also reached the approximate price point from which it pulled back in February.If it sustains itself above $82 per share, I think it will run higher in the near term, perhaps even retesting levels above $100 per share. A pullback could mean that it retests support in the mid-$70s per share range.It could also portend the beginning of a trading range between the low $60s and low $80s per share level.Another critical point could come Aug.1 when the San Francisco-based financial tech firm reports earnings for the second quarter. Since SQ will likely report an earnings beat, investors should watch forward guidance. This could provide the catalyst needed to drive Square stock for the foreseeable future. The Bottom Line on Square StockInvestors need more clarity on the equity's direction before buying SQ stock. Square supports a massive growth rate and continues to make the moves that could make its ecosystem one of the most influential in all of tech.However, the price of Square stock has reached levels where it pulled back in February. At this point, investors need to know that SQ is not forming a double top in the low $80s per share range.If it closes in the mid-$80s per share range or higher, it could retest that $101.15 per share high. If it pulls back, investors should wait until the stock finds its next inflection point.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

883,0.4659,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. was fined 242 million euros ($272 million) by European Union antitrust regulators for deliberately pricing some chips so low they could eliminate a smaller rival.The penalty comes a year after Qualcomm was ordered to pay 997 million euros for thwarting rival suppliers to Apple Inc. The EU said Thursday’s fine was 1.27% of Qualcomm’s revenue last year and &quot;aimed at deterring market players&quot; from trying the same thing.The Qualcomm investigation targeted 3G chips for internet mobile dongles sold between 2009 and 2011. Regulators said these were sold below cost to Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., &quot;two strategically important customers,&quot; in order to push Icera, now owned by Nvidia Corp., out of the market.&quot;Icera was becoming a viable supplier of UMTS chipsets providing high data rate performance, thus posing a growing threat to Qualcomm’s chipset business,&quot; the EU said.Companies have complained about the slow pace of EU antitrust enforcement in fast-moving technology markets. Icera sought to draw in the EU by filing a complaint in 2010. It was sold to Nvidia a year later in 2011. The EU opened an investigation four years after that.Qualcomm said in a statement it will appeal and “expose the meritless nature of this decision.” It said it plans to provide a financial guarantee instead of paying the fine, until the courts have ruled.“The commission’s decision is based on a novel theory of alleged below-cost pricing over a very short time period and for a very small volume of chips,” Qualcomm’s general counsel Don Rosenberg said in the statement. “Contrary to the commission’s findings, Qualcomm’s alleged conduct did not cause anti-competitive harm to Icera.”Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple ChipsLast year Qualcomm was handed the EU’s fifth-largest antitrust penalty over payments to Apple that the EU said were an illegal ploy to ensure only its chips were used in iPhones and iPads. San Diego-based Qualcomm is challenging the fine at the EU courts.Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is unique among semiconductor makers in that it gets most of its profit from licensing patents. Makers of handsets pay the company royalties, whether or not they use its chips. That lucrative profit pool has come under attack as governments around the world scrutinized Qualcomm’s business practices.(Updates with Qualcomm response in sixth, seventh paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net, Peter Chapman, Christopher ElserFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.062,0.862,0.076,1

887,0.9152,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, as the Apple Inc. supplier shrugs off a smartphone slump and U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co. to ride demand for cutting-edge chips.The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects sales of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion in the September quarter, ahead of average projections for about $8.9 billion. The Taiwanese company earlier reported a fall in June-quarter net income to NT$66.8 billion ($2.1 billion), surpassing the NT$65.7 billion estimated.TSMC’s solid outlook may allay fears of a persistent global chip downturn as Washington and Beijing clash. Its technological edge in chipmaking may help it grab an outsized portion of demand for advanced high-performance semiconductors, particularly as countries roll out ultra-fast fifth generation wireless networks. TSMC’s business has bottomed and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said.“We have passed the bottom of the cycle of our business, and should see our demand increase,” he told reporters in Taipei Thursday. “We see very, very strong demand” in the second half of 2019.Click here to read a liveblog of TSMC’s post-announcement briefingOrders for crypto-mining gear are expected to help TSMC’s third-quarter sales, according to Morgan Stanley, which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%. The typical year-end ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new chip-product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could also buoy the top line.“The guidance shows that management is confident on the recovery of demand in 2H, possibly boosted by new orders from AMD,” Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Shum said. “And, we expect the gross margin can return to 50%” by the fourth quarter.TSMC and its industry peers are grappling with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by top customer Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs that have hammered No. 2 customer Huawei. It previously reported a 4.5% slide in first-half revenue -- its worst January-to-June performance since 2011.While top executives expressed confidence that things are turning around, they warned of uncertainty springing from global trade tensions. Japan’s curbs on the export to South Korea of certain vital chipmaking materials could hammer industry players like Samsung Electronics Co., and further depress global smartphone demand.“The recent Japan-Korea dispute is probably the most uncertain” factor for TSMC’s fourth quarter, Chairman Mark Liu said.As the world’s largest player in the business of made-to-order chips, TSMC is a barometer for the broader industry as well as Apple, which accounts for about a fifth of its revenue. While uncertainty remains, its better-than-projected outlook underscores expectations the industry is bottoming out after a dismal few years, when consumers took longer to replace their smartphones and Bitcoin prices collapsed.The company on Thursday signaled its intention to invest for the future, saying its spending on capacity and upgrades could exceed $11 billion this year.TSMC’s shares stood largely unchanged before the announcement and have gained more than 12% this year.(Updates with commentary around Japan and Korea from the 7th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Gao Yuan, Sheryl Tian Tong Lee and Adela Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.065,0.843,0.092,1

890,0.9153,"(Bloomberg) -- All eyes will be on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s outlook after the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer suffered its worst sales drop in nearly eight years.Analysts expect the company’s third-quarter estimates -- due today after the close of trading -- to point to a revival after it took a hit from slowing demand amid U.S.-China trade tensions. At stake is the stock’s $35 billion rebound in market value since a January low.Apple Inc.’s ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are seen by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts to lift sales, which would also be boosted if President Donald Trump loosens trade restrictions on key customer Huawei Technologies Co.TSMC’s Sales May Swing Back to Growth on Huawei Orders: ReactAnalysts have forecast sales in the period to grow 15% from a quarter earlier, according to the average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s shares are up 12% this year, despite being whipsawed as the trade war escalated. They edged 0.6% higher Thursday morning.“The company’s second-half outlook looks to be improving, and third-quarter guidance will probably be strong given that some of the lingering uncertainty has started to fade,” said John Tsai, portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments Ltd. in Singapore. The trade spat between Japan and South Korea may also help TSMC, as Samsung Electronics Co. customers such as Qualcomm Inc. may seek to diversify, he added.TSMC saw sales drop 4.5% year-on-year in the first half, its worst performance since 2011. The company was grappling with the impact of a slowing global smartphone market and efforts by its biggest customer Apple to move beyond hardware. Then the trade war escalated into the U.S. blacklisting Huawei, TSMC’s second-largest customer.Yet its leading position in advanced technology, especially in 5G and artificial intelligence, helped it secure revenue. Chip orders for crypto mining are also expected to help TSMC’s third-quarter sales, according to Morgan Stanley, which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%.TSMC investors will also receive a NT$207 billion ($6.7 billion) dividend payout Thursday, according to stock exchange and company statements. The company is aiming for a dividend per share of at least NT$10 to lure value investors, something Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Robin Cheng and Mike Yang see as possible in 2020. They argue that rising free cash flow justifies a re-rating of the stock.Here are some highlights of 3Q 2019 estimates:Gross margin: 48.3% (19 estimates)Revenue: NT$276.6b (22 estimates)Net income (GAAP): NT$96.04b (20 estimates)Operating profit: NT$103.5b (15 estimates)Timing: release after market July 18(Updates prices.)To contact the reporters on this story: Cindy Wang in Taipei at hwang61@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net, David Watkins, Philip GlamannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.063,0.841,0.096,1

According to CB Insights, there are something like 39 fintechs worth $1 billion or more. Together, those 39 companies are worth an estimated $147.4 billion.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsumers like to use apps to manage their finances. Data from 2016 suggests the average person uses between 1-3 apps to get the job done. As fintechs continue to create new apps to handle different aspects of our financial lives, I'm sure more young investors will gravitate to them.  * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace With that in mind, here are 10 investment apps for young investors to consider, as they put their hard-earned money to work.    AcornsSource: via AcornsThe problem for most young investors is that they don't have a lot of money to invest because of student loans, steep rents, low wages etc. While understandable, the Acorns app allows you to invest your spare change to get the process started. Another exciting service Acorns has developed is Found Money, which uses brand loyalty to build your investment account. So, every time you buy something at one of the Found Money partners, that company credits your Acorns account with the applicable savings. The one thing to be aware of is the fees. Until you get a larger account balance, the monthly fees vary between $1-$3. That is going to seem high. For example, it charges $2 a month for an IRA account. If you have $1,000 in that account, the annual fee is 2.4%. If you have $10,000, that fee drops to 0.24%.  E-TradeIf you're going to buy stocks, ETFs, or even mutual funds, you're going to need a discount brokerage account to buy the investments. E-Trade isn't the cheapest discount broker. It charges $6.95 a trade, but gets a 4.5 rating out of 5 from NerdWallet, primarily because of its excellent mobile app, excellent customer support and large investment selection. The discount broker has two mobile apps that are both available on iOS and Android.The E-Trade mobile investing app provides options such as stock screening that help you find the right stocks to buy. It can even be accessed on Apple Watch. The second mobile app is OptionsHouse, the company's options specialist, that lets you make options trades on the go.  It doesn't hurt that E-Trade's parent is E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC), a company with an $11.4 billion market cap.  * 4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush The only downside: you'll pay more per trade if you aren't an active trader. MintSource: Mike Mozart via Wikimedia (Modified)If you can't save any money, you won't be able to invest. That's where Mint.com comes into play. Mint is a free personal finance app from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) that helps users track their spending, create a budget, and generally gets you smarter about money. It even lets you know when bills are due and what you can afford to pay. Over 15 million people use Mint in the U.S. and Canada to keep their finances straight. Intuit uses this free app to inform you about its other products such as Turbo Tax, which cost money to use and are also very helpful for saving money. It's an excellent loss leader. It will put you on stronger financial footing if you use it on an ongoing basis.   Motif InvestingYoung investors interested in investing apps might want to take a look at Motif Investing, the California tech startup that uses data science and automation to create thematic portfolios that its 350,000 customers can buy with a click of a button. CEO Hardeep Walia found a way to use data science to find the best investment themes and companies benefiting from those themes. If you want to bet on the next great biotech stock, Motif has a portfolio called Feeling Better About Biotech, a basket of up to 30 biotech stocks and ETFs that gives you an appropriate exposure to the industry. For as little as $300 in your trading account, you can own this portfolio of stocks. Motif also has an Impact account. For as little as $1,000 in your account, you can get a fully automated portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and values. The Impact account charges 0.25% annually while the trading account varies from free if you use a next market open trade to as high as $19.95 a trade depending on the type of portfolio you're building.  * 7 Stocks Being Inflated by Low Rates  If you're interested in owning one or two stocks, Motif is probably not for you.  RobinhoodSource: via Robinhood BlogOf the apps listed in this article, Robinhood is the investing app most likely followed and used by millennials. Robinhood officially launched in December 2014. It provides commission-free investing in stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. Since its founding Robinhood has grown to a customer base of over four million active users, many of them young investors; its average user is 32. Estimates suggest that Robinhood, which counts Snoop Dog as an investor, could be valued at as much as $10 billion.    Robinhood came under scrutiny in 2018 when it tried to launch a checking account for its customers that would pay 3%, didn't charge any fees and was covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. The program never got off. It is currently working with regulators to create a cash management plan that will get off the ground.In the meantime, the commission-free service for trading continues to gain popularity with investors. SoFiSource: Shutterstock Its official name at its founding in 2011 was Social Finance Inc. It made student loans. Eight years later, it still makes student loans but has expanded into other areas of financial services, including personal loans, mortgages, bank accounts, and investing products and services. On July 8, SoFi launched Stock Bits, a new service that allows investors to buy fractional shares of popular stocks. If you want to own a dollar's worth of 50 stocks, you now can. It's specifically designed for those who are new to investing. &quot;People are told to 'buy what they like,' but when what they like costs over $100 or $1,000 per share, first-time investors are priced out,&quot; said Anthony Noto, CEO at SoFi. &quot;Investing is a financial requirement for achieving financial independence, and it is our focus to remove the barriers to getting started by providing features like Stock Bits for SoFi Invest.&quot;  * 7 Services Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 SoFi had a challenging year in 2018. Laying off more than 7% of its staff due to weakness in its mortgage products, I believe Stock Bits could be an innovation that lifts the San Francisco financial services company to new heights. StashSource: Shutterstock The Stash Investment App was launched in October 2015. It's premise was simple: provide Americans with the tools, guidance and confidence to grow their savings. Almost four years later, Stash has more than two million people saving and investing using its investing app. For as little as $5, you can own fractional shares in companies you support and believe in. However, we're not done. It also allows you to invest in portfolios of stocks through ETFs for as little as $5. That means you can own some of the most popular ETFs for a fraction of what you'd pay to hold them on your own.The Money Under 30 website recently reviewed the Stash investing app, suggesting it is well made and well designed. Competing with Acorns for the attention of young investors, Stash charges $1 per month until you hit $5,000. It then charges 0.25% annually. In addition to the management fee Stash charges, you also pay the management fee of the ETFs. Like Acorns, it's an app that makes more sense when you get to $5,000 in your account. WealthsimpleSource: Shutterstock Wealthsimple is a Toronto-based robo-advisor that provides ready-made investment portfolios to people in Canada, the U.S., and the UK. Founded in 2014, it now controls 70% of the digital advisory space in Canada and is slowly making inroads in the U.S. where it launched in early 2017. At the end of March, Wealthsimple had CAD$4.3 billion in assets under management and more than 100,000 clients in the three countries where it operates.In March, the company launched Wealthsimple Trade, which provides commission-free investing in Canada for stocks and ETFs. It's the first company in Canada to do what Robinhood's doing in the U.S.  It's managed to snag 25,000 users in the first four months of operation; the average age of its users is 31. Like Robinhood, a lot of its users are buying cannabis stocks. The banks are also popular, as are some of the big tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).   * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace Delivering an attractive and easy to use mobile app, expect Wealthsimple to make waves in the U.S. market in the next couple of years.

922,0.9909,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has its share of challenges.The mobile chip maker saw a nice pop in mid-April, with shares rising from about $57 up to as high as $90 after settling its litigation with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But concerns with a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust ruling have pushed the stock down to the $65-$75 price level.With government rulings threatening the company's competitive advantage, what is the next move for Qualcomm stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Read on to see why QCOM stock is a hold: Good News and Bad News for QCOMThe April Apple settlement boosted Qualcomm stock. After years of an ugly patent dispute, Apple settled, agreeing to pay Qualcomm between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion and start a six-year licensing agreement.This good news helped push QCOM stock to new highs. Unfortunately, it was chased with a heavy dose of bad news.In May, Qualcomm stock tumbled after a ruling from the FTC. The FTC found that the company was engaging in unfair trade practices, exploiting its size to keep out competition and squeeze cell phone manufacturers. Qualcomm was ordered to license its technology to rival chip makers, negatively impacting the company's &quot;edge.&quot;But Qualcomm has received a reprieve: the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has asked the appeals cause to pause the antitrust ruling. The DoJ cited &quot;Qualcomm's critical role in 5G technology in the short-term&quot; as the rationale behind their decision.Does this mean QCOM is out of the woods? Maybe, maybe not. While the DoJ and other agencies believe Qualcomm's market power to be in the national interest, it is clear that QCOM's days of high margin licensing could be over.Without high margins, it becomes tougher to justify Qualcomm's valuation. With nonexistent growth, investors need a reason to keep bidding up QCOM shares. Qualcomm Earnings: Where is the Growth?QCOM last announced earnings on May 1st. For the quarter ending March 31, 2019, sales were down 5% year-over-year (YoY), primarily due to declines in the company's QTL licensing segment (down 8% YoY).Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 FY19 was 77 cents a share, about the same (78 cents) as in Q2 FY18.The company's aggressive share buyback program has been a factor in maintaining EPS. Qualcomm bought back $22.6 billion worth of shares in FY18, and has already bought back $1.02 billion in FY19. The company has $7.8 billion remaining under their current stock repurchase program.Qualcomm has also been able to maintain EPS via cost cutting. As discussed in the last 10-Q, QCOM successfully reduced annual operating costs by $1 billion.But to move the needle, Qualcomm needs organic growth. While the adoption of 5G is a solid future catalyst, it could be years before the new technology reaches critical mass. Qualcomm's investor communications speak little of &quot;game-changers&quot; in the pipeline.However, even with a lack of a growth story, Qualcomm does not trade at a discount. Let's take a look at its earnings multiples relative to peers: QCOM Stock Fairly ValuedCompared to its peers in the semiconductor space, Qualcomm's valuation seems reasonable. QCOM stock trades at 15 times forward earnings, and has a EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.9.Here are the earnings multiple metrics for Qualcomm's peers:Intel (NASDAQ:INTC): 11x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 7.3Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN): 20.6x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 15.4Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO): 12x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 14.2With Qualcomm stock trading at EBITDA multiples similar to AVGO and TXN, it is hard to make a value case for QCOM. Until a solid discount to peers emerges, it is tough to find a compelling reason to enter the stock. Bottom Line: Avoid QCOM StockFor investors looking to enter Qualcomm today, the stock is not a buy. Despite the reprieve from the DoJ, Qualcomm's competitive advantage is materially impacted by the FTC decision.If the high operating margins of licensing are impacted, it becomes tougher to justify QCOM stock's current valuation. QCOM could be a buy if it starts trading at a discount to TXN and AVGO, but for the time being the stock appears fairly valued relative to its peers.On the other hand, QCOM could be attractive to dividend investors. As InvestorPlace contributor Brad Kenagy pointed out, QCOM offers a fairly high dividend yield (3.3%). Coupled with the company's buyback strategy, QCOM shareholders could see benefit even if the share price treads water.The next big move in QCOM stock will likely come from the company's earnings announcement on July 31st. Excluding the one-time item from the Apple agreement, QCOM projects quarterly non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between 70 cents and 80 cents per share, down 20-30% YoY.If QCOM exceeds expectations, shares could see a bump. But given they are not out of the woods regarding the antitrust decision, additional upside remains limited.Investors should take all of these factors into consideration before initiating a position in Qualcomm stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

For their part, OTC-listed Grayscale Etherium Trust (OTCMKTS:ETHE) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) were slammed 7.25% and 12.75%, respectively.Tuesday's fiery political theater on Capitol Hill against FB stock should come as no surprise. U.S. regulators are already investigating whether the social media platform and fellow tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have abused their market positions and hindered competition at the expense of consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFacebook's Libra simply adds more fuel to the fire.It stands to reason FB stock would be under pressure given the broader market's mild profit-taking after Trump's latest tweet stating the trade war isn't going to be easily resolved spooked Wall Street. But that wasn't the case.Despite the perceived risks, investors continue to ignore FB stock's headline scares. In Tuesday's session, the indifference added up to a gain of 0.12% in Facebook shares. It's not a lot. Still, the defiant bid does follow a rally of about 28% since U.S. authorities began grilling FB in June. What's more, the longer-term Facebook price chart suggests an even larger rally could be close at hand. FB Stock Monthly Chart  Click to EnlargeI last discussed FB stock shortly after U.S. regulators' initial inquiry into the company. A technically favorable price drop on the news which tested 2019's Fibonacci 50% support level has gone on to carve out gains of around 17% over the last few weeks.Now and with shares closing in on their all-time-highs, FB stock is offering investors another opportunity to go long shares.On Facebook's monthly chart, shares recently broke out of a three-month consolidation within the larger corrective pattern as resistance at $198.48 was overtaken. With shares less than 3% above the trigger price, FB stock is still in position for buying.Given the duration and depth of Facebook's year-long and 45% deep cup-like base, an eventual test of Facebook stock's pattern and all-time-high of $218.62 from last July should lead to a breakout to fresh highs. And based on a rough estimate of the base's depth, a projected rally toward $300 is possible by next year. FB Stock StrategyBuy FB stock today. For managing position risk, the recommendation is to size FB stock with a blended stop-loss beneath $180 for protection. If Facebook breaks out to new highs, taking partial profits in-between $225 - $235 is a good start to reducing exposure as well.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Apple stock has performed well since the start of June, posting an 18% gain since June 3, but on July 30 all bets are off.Source: Shutterstock Bulls -- and that includes the majority of Wall Street analysts -- feel that even with recent gains, AAPL stock is under-priced. The company's guidance points to the potential for good news, at least compared to Q1 and Q2.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip However, AAPL is creeping close to its 2019 high of $211.75 and there's a possibility they might deliver underwhelming results on July 30, sending the Apple stock price tumbling. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Two Quarters, Two Revenue Declines, Positive Market ReactionAt the start of 2019, Apple investors entered into territory they hadn't experienced since 2001. In Q1, the company reported a year-over-year revenue decline of 5%, then repeated that performance in Q2. In both cases, the root cause of the overall decline was slumping iPhone revenue, down 15% in Q1 and 17% in Q2. Apple's Q1 earnings report came with plenty of drama to kick off the year. On January 2, Apple issued a guidance note, warning of &quot;lower than anticipated iPhone revenue.&quot; That resulted in AAPL stock getting walloped. It lost 10% of its value the next day.However, after the company actually reported those Q1 earnings on January 29, Apple stock popped. When Apple reported its Q2 earnings, demand surged for AAPL stock and it closed up nearly 6% the following day. Why the positive market reaction?The underlying reasons for the two positive outcomes to losing quarters are different. In Q1, the guidance letter had investors prepared for the worst, with many selling off their Apple stock in a panic. The actual reported decline numbers probably came as a relief compared to the outcome some had been picturing. In Q2, the company outperformed (lowered) earnings expectations and issued better than anticipated guidance for Q3 -- revenue of between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion.  What Will Happen to AAPL Stock When Q3 Earnings Are Reported?If Apple hits revenue near the middle or upper end of its guidance range, it will beat the $53.3 billion it earned in Q3 2018. Doing so would break its two-quarter &quot;losing&quot; streak. There's a very good chance that the market reaction to that symbolic victory would be positive and result in another bump for the Apple stock price. That being said, there are risks that could result in AAPL delivering lower than expected earnings. In particular, the trade war between the U.S and China may have cooled during the quarter, but the lingering effects still could have resulted in further erosion of Apple sales in China. Even in Q2, the $10.2 billion in sales from the Chinese market represented nearly 18% of AAPL's overall revenue. Any significant change there is going to have a big impact on the bottom line.If the company comes in at the low end of its guidance, that would mark three straight quarters of declining revenue, and this time investors might not be as forgiving.At the end of the day, despite two straight quarters of revenue decline -- something unheard of in the iPhone-era of Apple -- AAPL stock has still performed very strongly in 2019, with growth of over 43%. That's better than many other tech giants. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has posted near 34% growth for 2019.The majority of analysts still have Apple stock as a buy, with a 12-month price target of $218.50, meaning there is still time to get in on the action. With Apple's Q3 earnings report coming in just weeks, now might be the time to buy those Apple shares.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The United States Department of Justice has asked the government to hold off on enforcing the recent antitrust ruling. In its argument, the DOJ called the ruling a threat to &quot;competition, innovation and national security.&quot; This sent QCOM shares higher in Wednesday trading.This offers welief to QCOM stock investors. Just when the dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) appeared resolved, the Federal Trade Commission won a ruling against the company. Now, the government has ruled that Qualcomm is a monopoly, and the decision would change the way it does business and alter licensing agreements. But with the DOJ siding with Qualcomm, the company has a better chance at maintaining its market standing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the company faces more challenges than antitrust issues. Due to Qualcomm's presence in China, the company finds itself in the middle of the trade dispute. Whatever happens with U.S.-China trade could have profound effects on QCOM stock. However, with a relatively low valuation and future growth driven by the adoption of 5G, Wall Street has likely priced the antitrust and trade-related challenges into the price of QCOM. Qualcomm Stock Offers Compelling FinancialsFrom a valuation and growth standpoint, Qualcomm seems like a slam dunk. For this year, analysts only expect an earnings increase of 2.7%. However, with the advent of 5G, they expect profits to grow by 34.8% next year. They predict an average growth rate of 27.05% per year for the next five years. Investors can currently buy this growth for about 15.4 times forward earnings.Also, amid stagnation, the dividend continues to serve investors in QCOM stock well. This year's payout stands at $2.48 per share, a yield of almost 3.3%. Moreover, this payout has increased every year since QCOM began paying a dividend in 2010.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills  Financials Not the Driving Force of QCOM StockUnfortunately for QCOM stock investors, forces other than financial metrics largely influence the stock. Instead, QCOM has traded on these lawsuits surrounding its highly coveted chipsets. These chips have become all the more critical as the world begins to adopt 5G wireless.Many regard this technological edge as a monopoly. It reminds me of how the dominance of Windows bolstered Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the 1990s. That likely also explains why Apple decided to settle their years-long legal dispute with the company. Now, the appeals court will have to decide whether the FTC can force Qualcomm to renegotiate contracts regarding the licensing of its chipsets. With the DOJ standing on Qualcomm's side, QCOM's chances to prevail have probably increased. Still, the outcome remains uncertain. Geopolitics Also Influences QCOMInvestors must also contend with another factor rarely seen outside of the oil and gas industry -- geopolitics. China made up approximately two-thirds of Qualcomm's revenue in 2018. South Korea accounted for about 14%, while only about 2.7% of the company's revenue came from its home market in the U.S. As InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin pointed out, the company has paid fines levied by antitrust authorities in both China and South Korea.Geopolitics also touches on an interesting point brought up by InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto. Mr. Enomoto points out the national security implications involved with Qualcomm. With the Chinese government backing Huawei, QCOM could find itself in trouble without similar backing from the U.S. government. Since the Department of Defense (DOD) met with the FTC during the case, it will likely go to bat for QCOM. While nobody knows the outcome of this dispute, the DOD backing should ease the minds of investors hesitant about QCOM stock.  * 7 Best of the Best Fidelity Funds to Buy  The Bottom LineStill, the price of Qualcomm stock likely reflects both the antitrust and geopolitical challenges. As mentioned before, QCOM stock trades at over 15 times forward earnings. With the DOJ now firmly on its side, Qualcomm's valuation has increased. However, if these concerns did not affect QCOM at all, I think the stock would trade at a much higher price-to-earnings ratio.Furthermore, the trade dispute will inevitably end at some point. Both the U.S. and Chinese economies depend heavily on one another. Hence, I do not see the disagreement destroying Qualcomm's revenue stream in China. Additionally, with 27%+ profit growth projected every year for the foreseeable future, adoption of 5G looks set to propel QCOM higher regardless of the trade dispute.Prospective buyers should get in and collect a generous, growing dividend. The growth will come as 5G expands and as antitrust and trade regulators resolve the various disputes.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Just some of the catalysts include the expectation of lower interest rates and a truce with the U.S.-China trade war.Source: Shutterstock And yes, some Wall Street analysts are warming up to Square stock. Consider Raymond James' John Davis, who raised his rating on the shares from underperform to market perform. The main reason for this is he believes that Square's debit card is likely to see increased momentum, adding as much as $100 million to the top-line next year.No doubt, this would be a big deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut of course, much of the focus for SQ stock will be on the near-term. In fact, we'll get the second-quarter results on Aug. 1.So what is on tap?  Well, in terms of revenues, the consensus forecast is calling for $557 million, up about 45% on a year-over-year basis. As for the bottom line, the estimate is 16 cents a share, compared to 13 cents during the same period last year.  All in all, there remains quite a bit of optimism on Wall Street.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip  The Square Stock Price and Other NewsDuring the quarter, there has been much activity, especially with partnerships. Here's a look at some of the notable events:  * Square teamed up with the Ogden Raptors - a minor league baseball team that's part of the Los Angeles Dodgers farm system - to provide payment services. The deal involves both online sources, such as with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and offline ones.  * Called Square for Restaurants, this is a set of order management integrations for Postmates, DoorDash and Chowly. All these services are not part of the core POS system, which means eliminating the use of various other tablets and manual entry of orders.  * Square has entered a deal to be the payments and POS provider for the Indianapolis 500. The event includes more than 300,000 customers and about 500 concession stands. It's actually the largest sports venue in the world.  * A resident of southern California has sued Square because he alleges the company's invoice system mistakenly sent his personal medical history to a friend. His attorneys are looking to put together a class-action suit. Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal recently wrote a piece on how Square's system has misfired on various occasions.  * Now when it comes to SQ stock, one of the most important growth drivers is its Cash App. According to Instinet analysts Dan Dolev and Conan Leon, the app has 56.1 million users, which is more than PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) fast-growing Venmo. They currently have a $100 price target on SQ stock, which was recently increased from $90. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare CEO Jack Dorsey has certainly done a great job with the company. What started as a simple app has quickly transformed into a strong platform with a robust ecosystem. It's also amazing that he has been able to do this while still the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Yet there are definitely issues with SQ stock. Even though the company deserves a premium valuation, it is still quite steep, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 73X.Sell-side analysts are generally cautious as well, with three sell ratings and 17 holds. And the average price target assumes zero upside from current levels.For the most part, Square stock is pricing in much of the good news. So this could make the upcoming earnings report a bit dicey since the growth rate has already been trending down during the past few quarters.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

942,-0.2648,"Ever since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its now-iconic iPhone, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) has been in crisis mode. Of course, what has consistently dragged on the company is that it has never really left that mode. Nokia stock peaked around the $40 level in 2007. Today, you can pick up shares for a little over $5.  Source: Shutterstock Of course, with such a low price point, this attracts contrarian buyers. After all, we're talking about Nokia stock, not some nameless, faceless upstart tooling around in the pink sheets. True, the Nokia brand isn't anywhere near as relevant as it once was. However, the Finnish telecom firm very much has clout.This is evident through the company's many wheeling and dealings. Recently, NOK announced that China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) selected Nokia's solution for the Chinese telecom's 4G and 5G networks . Significantly, China Unicom has a very ambitious target to deliver 5G wireless connectivity within this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Plus, Nokia stock benefits from geopolitical tailwinds. Earlier this year, I wrote that our own telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) has &quot;critical value beyond the print.&quot;Primarily, what underlines the U.S.-China trade war is the two sides' rush to dominate next-generation technologies. Thus, companies like AT&T represent more than just capitalistic concerns; rather, they facilitate the pathway for these technologies to advance American interests.Second, the trade war has temporarily erased Huawei - the largest supplier of mobile network technology - from the picture. That gives an obvious opportunity for NOK, and by logical deduction, Nokia stock.And as our own James Brumley pointed out, Nokia has struck with multiple awarded contracts. But is that enough for NOK stock? NOK Stock and the FundamentalsAdmittedly, when I saw Brumley's contribution towards Nokia stock, I only read the headlines. But it was enough of a catchy one that I decided to look at the price chart before reading what my colleague had to say.Again, at $5, NOK stock is a very tempting mistress. Not only is it still a relatively well-known brand, but it's also levered to an extremely viable business. Everyone that's anyone is racing for 5G dominance. Moreover, 5G has serious geopolitical and even military implications.Such an environment suggests that the next-gen telecom network will provide robust revenue channels. That's especially true for Nokia if it can claim first-to-market advantages in specific regions or technical subsegments.And to Brumley's argument, Nokia is securing contracts with big names, such as China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and BT Group (NYSE:BT). Obviously, these are big tailwinds for NOK stock.But what isn't so appealing is trading sentiment. Specifically, Nokia has no discernible correlation with revenue trends. For instance, from the first quarter of 2013 through Q1 2019, Nokia shares and revenue had a correlation coefficient of -20%. Between Q1 2016 through Q1 2019, the correlation inversely strengthened to 34%. However, this is still not a statistically significant relationship.  Click to EnlargeWhy does this matter? Because you really want your core investments to make rational sense. In other words, if Nokia's management says they're on a recovery path, I don't expect NOK stock to jump just on that alone. However, if Nokia proved its point through sales increases, I expect shares to steadily tick higher.Longer-term, that hasn't happened. For example, in Q4 2015, Nokia rang up only $3.95 billion in sales. Three years later, the company delivered revenue of $7.84 billion. Still, shares dropped on average from $6.31 to $5.57. Nokia Stock Is an Interpretive ArtworkIn my last article about NOK stock, I suggested that it was nothing more than a short-term trade. Largely, I feel the same way because of the lack of rationality in the market.However, I concede that this lack of rationality also presents an opportunity. To quote Brumley, Nokia &quot;has gotten little to no credit for its newly-won contracts, as investors struggle to get past the company's disappointing first-quarter results.&quot;Perhaps the reason why Nokia stock has little correlation with the fundamentals is that most folks simply don't recognize the opportunity. Therefore, if you take the risk now, you potentially have a front-row seat to a massive recovery.But it could also mean that the markets have reason to doubt Nokia. Brumley even conceded that Q2 2019 numbers may not look great.And let's remind ourselves why Q1 figures were so disappointing: Nokia failed to supply 5G telecom equipment in time. Stated differently, if you buy Nokia stock, you're doing so on technical potential, not on proven fundamentals.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock.

944,-0.9813,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook, Google and Amazon grappled with multiple attacks across Washington from lawmakers and President Donald Trump over a range of grievances that underscored the kind of reckoning the companies could face.House Democrats on Tuesday grilled Amazon.com Inc. over perceived conflicts of interest on its platform, while senators from both parties slammed Facebook Inc. over its plan to introduce a cryptocurrency, saying the company can’t be trusted. Alphabet Inc.’s Google got broadsides from Senate Republicans who complained of anti-conservative bias and from Trump, who said he wants the Justice Department to look into its work in China.The pressure isn’t going away. Facebook Vice President David Marcus is facing another day of testimony Wednesday answering questions about its Libra cyrptocurrency project from the House Committee on Financial Services. Panel chairwoman Maxine Waters has called on the company to stop the project while Congress investigates.The technology platforms that came under fire Tuesday were darlings of official Washington in the Obama years as they grew to dominate their respective markets, from online retail to social media to digital advertising. That admiration has been swept away amid criticism from Republicans and Democrats over competition, privacy and control over content on their platform. At the root of the concerns is the view the companies have grown too big and powerful.Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio called Facebook “dangerous” while Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, portrayed Amazon as a “trillion-dollar” retailing behemoth that that can crush sellers on its platform. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, suggested a Google was being evasive. “You’re managing to be less candid than Mark Zuckerberg,” he said, referring to the Facebook chairman and co-founder, who testified before Congress last year.The scrutiny by lawmakers threatens to go beyond criticism of the companies to rein in their business models. Across Capitol Hill Tuesday, lawmakers were zeroing on specific aspects of the companies’ businesses, raising the possibility of legislation aimed at toughening regulation of the industry.Cicilline, who is leading a House antitrust investigation into competition in digital markets, told reporters that his inquiry was still in the fact-gathering stage but that it should eventually lead to legislative steps. Tech companies are incapable of regulating themselves, he said.“I think it will absolutely require some action by Congress, either by way of regulation, new statutory enactments, new resources for antitrust agencies, more likely a combination of those three things,” he said.Cicilline’s committee questioned executives of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple Inc. about whether they are harming competition. Amazon faced particular criticism with Cicilline suggesting its business model suffers from conflicts of interest and that it can use its control over data to thwart competition from third-party sellers on its platform.Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton denied the company uses data it collects on sales to favor its own products over third-party sellers. He also argued that it’s common in the retail industry for stores to sell their own brands that compete against others.Cicilline fired back: “The difference is Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data on millions of purchases and billions in commerce and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and favor its own product -- that is not the same as a local retailer,” he said.In a separate hearing, a bipartisan group of senators told Google’s global policy chief, Karan Bhatia, that they continued to have concerns about the breadth of a liability shield that protects platforms like YouTube and Facebook from lawsuits over content posted by third parties.Cruz, fellow Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii cast doubt on part of a 1996 law that helped internet companies thrive, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, by providing the legal protection.Lawmakers increasingly want to limit that protection, which was already trimmed in cases of sex trafficking last year. They cite concerns about online abuse, hatred, election misinformation and allegations of anticonservative bias.At the Senate hearing on Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, years of missteps over its handling of data and user privacy and exploitation of its platform by Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign caught up with the social media platform as lawmakers from both parties assailed the company and called it untrustworthy.“I don’t trust Facebook,” said Republican Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, “and I’m not alone.”Brown, the committee’s ranking Democrat, denounced the company, calling it “dangerous” and comparing it to a toddler with a book of matches.“Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience,” he said.American officials, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Trump, have expressed skepticism about the Libra project. Facebook has other problems in Washington, including a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over a scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Last week, the FTC approved a $5 billion settlement to resolve the case, but lawmakers and privacy advocates objected, saying that it didn’t go far enough.Regulators were aghast that the tech giant wasn’t able to address concerns about money laundering, consumer protection and other potential risks after Facebook presented a white paper to more than a dozen officials from the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies about the Libra project, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.“The calls to break up, the calls for data privacy laws, the calls for concern around Libra and Calibra are all around this idea of kind of the abuse of the dominance of the platforms, the lack of accountability,” Ashkan Soltani, the former FTC chief technologist, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.&#92;--With assistance from Daniel Stoller, Kurt Wagner, Robert Schmidt, Ben Bain and Gerrit De Vynck.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.094,0.835,0.071,-1
945,0.9971,"You don't have to look just at the technical charts to understand the appeal of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). Thanks to the momentum of rapidly increasing digitalization, smaller companies are able to disrupt much larger establishments. With ROKU, the company specializes in over-the-top streaming devices that essentially bypass broadcast-television platforms (and their associated restrictions); hence, the dramatic rise in the Roku stock price.Source: Shutterstock And it's not just the disruption that has many investors eyeballing this upstart firm. Instead, ROKU has already levered an outsized impact on the broader media landscape. Shortly after its introduction, the company's streaming-TV equipment dominated market share, beating out behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Even more impressive, ROKU has held onto its overwhelming superiority. For instance, the company leads the connected-TV devices market, accounting for 30% of U.S. sales in the first quarter. Notably, the number-two provider is Sony's (NYSE:SNE) ultra-popular PlayStation network. Obviously, this provides an even greater impetus to buy up Roku stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond And if that wasn't enough, research firm Strategy Analytics forecasts that Roku's connected-TV devices market share could hit 70%. From that perspective, investors can justify the astounding leap in the Roku stock price.From everything that we see, as well as the company's track record, very few analysts will contest the point that ROKU is a worthy tech name. But the question now isn't whether the streaming-equipment provider has a viable business. Rather, it's whether prospective buyers should consider taking a stab at Roku stock.Although I respect the disruption, I can't recommend going all-in here. Let me explain why: Roku Stock Trading Well Above Its FundamentalsAmong the many bullish factors driving the Roku stock price is the underlying company's monthly active user (MAU) base. In the most recent Q1 earnings report, ROKU registered 29.1 million MAUs on $206.7 million in revenue. Thus, the company generates $7.10 of sales per user.It's an impressive feat because between Q3 2016 and Q3 2018, the revenue generated per MAU appeared to be declining. But come Q4 2018 with its record-busting sales haul of nearly $276 million on 27 million MAUs, the narrative quickly turned incredibly bullish.  Click to EnlargeMoreover, Q1 2019's sales-per-user metric of $7.10 exceeded the year-ago quarter's tally of $6.57. In Q1 2017, sales per user measured $7.05. Thus, we're seeing a noticeable shift in individual consumer demand.So why shouldn't investors consider piling into ROKU? Because at some point, the fundamentals matter. Yes, the company dominates the streaming-TV and equipment market ahead of established players. But the established players are all profitable. On the other hand, ROKU is not, which detracts from its overall argument.Let's give credit where it's due. Management has done an incredible job whittling down earnings losses last year. For example, back in 2017, net income measured a whopping loss of $63.5 million. Last year, losses were slightly less than $9 million.But in Q1 2019, the streaming-equipment provider recorded a loss of $9.7 million, noticeably more pronounced than the $6.6 million loss in Q1 2018. Stated differently, the company is in a race to have its revenue potential convert to real earnings.Working against management, though, is the fact that MAU year-over-year growth has steadily slipped from Q3 2017's 48% to Q1 2019's 40%. Plus, current per-user revenue is still down from Q4 2016's haul of $10.99. Just Look at the Charts…At the top, I commented that you don't need to look at the technical charts to gauge Roku's massive outperformance and popularity. But on the flip side, the technicals also provide ammunition for the bears.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Consider that on a YOY basis, shares have skyrocketed over 112%. But in terms of revenue, the company gained only 51%. Further, per-user revenue increased by only 8%. Don't get me wrong: these are strong numbers. But I don't they're strong enough to pile in at this price point.Also, please don't confuse this write-up as a perpetually bearish angle on Roku stock. As I mentioned, this company has a firm hold on the OTT market. Therefore, depending on the magnitude of a possible correction, I may be interested in picking some shares up myself.Invariably, though, you must stay agnostic with the markets. Right now, I'm afraid this consumer-tech firm has taken on an almost cult-like furor. Let it cool and at that point reconsider the narrative.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.

955,0.98,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. was challenged by a top House lawmaker over whether the online retail giant is harming competition as the biggest tech companies faced their harshest antitrust scrutiny in years on Capitol Hill.Democratic Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who chairs the House antitrust panel, put Amazon on the hot seat at a hearing Tuesday, suggesting its business model suffers from conflicts of interest and that it can use its control over data to thwart competition from third-party sellers on its platform.“You are selling your own products on a platform you control and they’re competing with products from other sellers,” Cicilline said.Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton denied the company uses data it collects on sales to favor its own products over third-party sellers. He also argued that it’s common in the retail industry for stores to sell their own brands that compete against others.Cicilline fired back: “The difference is Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data on millions of purchases and billions in commerce and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and favor its own product -- that is not the same as a local retailer,” he said.The exchange, as Amazon’s Prime Day sales event extended into a second day, came at hearing where four of the biggest U.S. tech firms -- Amazon, Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. -- defended their businesses against criticism that they are too dominant. The session marked the first time the companies have faced grilling from Congress about whether they are hindering competition.Cicilline said his inquiry is still in the fact-gathering stage but the series will eventually lead to legislative steps that go beyond self-regulation.“I think it will absolutely require some action by Congress, either by way of regulation, new statutory enactments, new resources for antitrust agencies, more likely a combination of those three things,” he told reporters after the executives testified.Cicilline is bearing down on the companies as antitrust enforcers prepare their own scrutiny after a mostly hands-off approach to the industry.The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust jurisdiction, have taken the first steps toward investigating conduct by the biggest companies by divvying up oversight with the Justice Department taking responsibility for Google and Apple, and FTC overseeing Facebook and Amazon.A report by the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center this year found that digital markets tend to be winner-take-all in which one firm comes to dominate. That creates an incentive for the companies to edge out new challengers that could threaten that dominance.Republican Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin on Tuesday cautioned against calls for breaking up the big technology companies.“Just because a business is big doesn’t mean that it is bad,” he said. Antitrust laws “do not exist to punish businesses just because they are big.”All four companies repeatedly insisted that they face abundant competition, from one another and from other companies. Although Amazon controls about half of U.S. e-commerce sales, Sutton pointed out the company makes up just 4% of all retail sales, with competition from Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co., among others. Facebook’s Director of Public Policy Matt Perault pointed to competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, among others.That argument met with skepticism from lawmakers. Representative Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, pointed out that Facebook has the most monthly active users worldwide of any social media platform, with its Instagram, Whatsapp, and Facebook messenger in the top six.“You can understand the skepticism because when a company owns four of the largest six entities measured by active users in the world in that industry, we have a word for that, and that’s monopoly – or at least monopoly power,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Daniel Stoller.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.045,0.872,0.083,1

The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is holding a hearing Tuesday on the market power of the largest tech companies. Executives from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google and Facebook are testifying. Here’s the latest from the committee room:Facebook Denies Its Integration Plan Designed to Thwart Breakup (5:37 p.m.)Facebook’s Matt Perault denied that the company’s planned integration of its Messenger app, its WhatsApp chat service and its Instagram photo app was designed to thwart calls to break up the properties.“There are many services in the market that offer more privacy-protective services,” he told Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Our pivot toward privacy with respect to inter-operating our services was because of the competition that we faced in the market.”Raskin had suggested the announcement was a “ploy” and said it coincided with growing calls to break up Facebook by splitting off WhatsApp and Instagram.Democrat David Cicilline, who chairs the panel, also asked Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton about reports that the fees merchants must pay have been increasing in recent years.“Aren’t these steady fee hikes by Amazon a pure exercise of its outsize buyer power?” Cicilline asked.Sutton said that the estimates weren’t accurate.“The fees that are necessary to be paid in our store to sell items have actually been steady for a number of years and slightly declining,” Sutton told Cicilline.Heated Exchange Over Amazon’s Third-Party Sellers (4:32 p.m.)Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is chairing the hearing, pressed Amazon on whether its business model suffers from a conflict of interest because it sells its own products that compete directly against those from third-party sellers. That is a complaint also raised by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.“You are selling your own products on a platform you control and they’re competing with products from other sellers,” Cicilline said.Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton said it’s common in retail for stores to sell their own brands that compete against others.Cicilline fired back: “The difference is Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data on millions of purchases and billions of commerce and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and favor its own product -- that is not the same as a local retailer,” he said.Cicilline repeatedly pressed Sutton about whether the company uses data on the third-party sellers to advantage its own products. Sutton said Amazon ranks results by the same criteria and doesn’t use data to compete against sellers.“You do collect enormous data,” Cicilline said. “You’re saying you don’t use that in any way to promote Amazon products, and I remind you sir, you’re under oath.”Cicilline says companies have de facto ‘immunity’ (3:38 p.m.)Cicilline slammed the dominance of the tech companies, saying they are shielded from competitive threats because of barriers to rivals that could potentially take them on. They also use their resources to prevent startups from challenging them and pose a risk to small businesses, he said.Cicilline said the dominance of tech companies stems from policy choices. Antitrust enforcers haven’t challenged a single one of their acquisitions or sued them for anticompetitive conduct like they did with Microsoft Corp. 20 years ago, he said.“Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,” Cicilline said in his opening remarks. “As a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.”“Together, these enforcement decisions have created a de facto immunity for online platforms,” Cicilline added.Companies argue they face widespread competition (2:56 p.m.)The four tech giants tried to head off criticism that they dominate their respective markets, as executives in prepared testimony all cited intense competition they say they face from rivals.Nate Sutton, a lawyer for Amazon, which controls about half of U.S. e-commerce sales, told the House antitrust panel that the company makes up just 4% of U.S. retail sales, with competition from Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co.Facebook’s Director of Public Policy Matt Perault pointed to competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, among others, in his remarks.The companies also touted their development of innovative products that have won over consumers and their investment in research and development. Google’s director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said the company spent $21.4 billion on R&D, three times more than in 2013.The hearing, led by Cicilline, started at about 3 p.m. Dozens of people were waiting in line to get into the hearing room.Here’s What Tech Faces in Washington:The hearing is one of a several that big tech companies face this week in Congress as Washington calls the giants to task for a range of concerns. President Donald Trump is pressuring the companies in Twitter barrages for issues including anti-conservative bias, while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have taken the first steps toward investigating their conduct. The Justice Department is taking responsibility for scrutiny of Google and Apple, as the FTC oversees Facebook and Amazon.Also on Tuesday, David Marcus, who leads Facebook’s Libra and block chain efforts, heard from disdainful Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the company’s proposed cryptocurrency.Trump said Tuesday morning that his administration will look into allegations by billionaire Peter Thiel that Google’s work with China is “seemingly treasonous.”Trump has also said he wants gather tech executives at the White House.Google’s global public policy chief is scheduled to testify Tuesday before a Senate hearing focused on allegations the company engages in censorship.More on tech and antitrust: Did Big Tech Get Too Big?

965,0.9792,"Stock buybacks had a gangbusters 2018, with companies purchasing $223 billion worth of their own stock in the final quarter of last year. That trend dropped down to a mere $205 billion in the first quarter of this year, but overall analysts expect this to be the biggest year for repurchasers yet. CEOs are thrilled about this development. Critics, less so. Buy What Backs? In case you need a refresher, a buyback is when a company purchases its own stock using cash reserves or profit. As we recently explained, this has the effect of driving up stock price by creating rarity, as the less shares of a company there are available to purchase on the stock market, the higher the price. Since CEOs typically own company shares and have various stock plans, buybacks make them wealthier without increasing their salary. So you can see why people like them. Big Fans While most CEOS, like Apple’s Tim Cook, are buyback fans, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon are particularly outspoken in their support. Dimon calls them a “no-brainer” and “an important tool that businesses must have to reallocate excess capital.&quot; Bye Buy One of the main complaints buyback critics have is that companies will use their excess capital to further enrich CEOs and investors, instead of spending it on employee compensation, research and development and other long-term investments. Buybacks have caught the ire of Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to introduce a bill that would require companies to increase employee compensation before they can repurchase shares. -Michael Tedder Photo: Brendan McDermid / REUTERS",0.037,0.831,0.132,1

967,0.9953,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports its Q4 earnings on July 18, and expectations are high. Its market cap of $1.06 trillion makes Microsoft the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, and MSFT stock has been up 37% this year. Microsoft stock closed at an all-time high of $138.90 on Friday, repeating that performance on Monday -- after breaking $139 early in the day. Despite the record highs, many analysts think there is still room for growth, with some now calling for MSFT to hit $150. Here's what has investors excited about Microsoft.Source: Shutterstock  MSFT Stock Continues Its Meteoric ClimbFor much of 2019, Microsoft news has been largely focused on the company's rise in value. Not that long ago, MSFT was dismissed as a tech dinosaur that completely bumbled the smartphone -- the most important device in the past decade, and the product that drove Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rise to the top. The PC market has been on a long, slow slide and with it goes Microsoft's Windows and Office revenue, along with MSFT stock. At least that was the thinking…However, that hasn't been quite the way things have played out. 2019 has seen Microsoft stock continue its relentless growth. In April, the company's market cap hit $1 trillion for the first time ever, and with yet another all-time high close of $138.90 MSFT is currently worth $1.06 trillion. At the moment, it's the only American company in that lofty trillion dollar club, with Apple currently worth $944.19 billion and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at $995 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Many investors remain bullish on MSFT, despite its record high valuation. In fact on Thursday, Cowen gave Microsoft an outperform rating and set a price target of $150 for Microsoft stock. Bets on the Cloud and Professional Networking are Paying OffOne of the keys to Cowen's bullish outlook on MSFT is the company's investments in cloud computing. Microsoft's Azure cloud service posted 93% revenue growth in Q3, and the company has been steadily gaining market share in the cloud computing market. According to numbers from Canalys, MSFT Azure's global market share hit 16.5% in Q4 2018. Amazon Web Services continues to be the undisputed leader with a 32.3% share, but Azure's rate of growth is significantly higher at 75.9% for 2018 compared to 46.3% for AWS.That Azure investment doesn't just mean revenue for Microsoft, it also makes initiatives like the company's new gaming cloud division possible. That technology will see MSFT's xCloud streaming game service launch this fall.Analysts also see revenue growth potential in Microsoft's ownership of professional networking site LinkedIn. That division saw 27% revenue growth in Q3. And Teams -- Microsoft's answer to Slack (NYSE:WORK) team collaboration software -- overtook Slack in July, with over 13 million daily users. Gaming and Surface Continues to Grow, While Windows Keeps ChuggingWindows and Office seemed to be well past their best-before dates with the decline of PC sales. However, the computer market is still far from dead and the company is able to sell Windows licenses for legacy machines as well as new models hitting the market, and that resulted in Windows OEM revenue being up 9% in Q3. Pushing a subscription model for Office has also paid off, with Office commercial and consumer revenue both showing healthy growth.Microsoft's investment in Surface hardware has also helped to boost MSFT stock, with Q3 revenue growth of 21%. The company's gaming revenue has also been up this year, despite a relatively poor showing for the Xbox One compared to competing game consoles in this generation. With the xCloud streaming gaming service expected later this year, and the new Xbox Project Scarlett game console due to launch in 2020, that gaming division should see revenue growth ramp up considerably.   * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace We'll see in two days whether Microsoft has been able to maintain the momentum it's showed so far this year. If those Q4 results are as good as expected, Microsoft stock could very well be on the path to Cowen's $150.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

970,0.9975,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. plans to fund original podcasts that would be exclusive to its audio service, according to people familiar with the matter, increasing its investment in the industry to keep competitors Spotify and Stitcher at bay.Executives at the company have reached out to media companies and their representatives to discuss buying exclusive rights to podcasts, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are preliminary. Apple has yet to outline a clear strategy, but has said it plans to pursue the kind of deals it didn’t make before.Apple all but invented the podcasting business with the creation of a network that collects thousands of podcasts from across the internet in a feed on people’s phones, smartwatches and computers. The Apple Podcast app still accounts for anywhere from 50% to 70% of listening for most podcasts, according to industry executives.The news sent shares of Spotify down as much as 2.7% to $150.09 in New York on Tuesday, marking the biggest intraday decline in three weeks. The stock had been up 36% this year through Monday’s close.After years without making substantial changes to its podcasting business, which first launched in 2005, Apple has recently focused on upgrading its app and has added new tools for podcast makers. Still, new entrants have encroached on Apple’s once-indomitable position, attracting new users by offering exclusive access to original podcasts.A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.Podcasts AppApple launched Podcast Analytics last year, rolling out a service that gives podcast makers more insight into their listeners and performance. This year, Apple announced a dedicated Podcasts app for Mac computers and launched a web interface to expand the amount of people who can listen to podcasts through its service.Apple placed executive Oliver Schusser in charge of podcasts and music, with Ben Cave helping oversee the podcasting strategy.“You are nowhere in podcasting if you don’t have shows listed in Apple podcasts,” said Lex Friedman, the chief revenue officer of Art19, which provides services to podcast producers such as Wondery Media and Tribune. But given all of the recent activity by its competition, “it would surprise me if Apple didn’t do anything with exclusives.”Video ServiceApple has refrained from funding podcasts thus far to avoid the perception of playing favorites. But the tech giant has evinced an interest in funding some of the programming it distributes. The company is producing dozens of original TV shows and movies for a new video service called Apple TV+. The first of those series will debut later this year.Spotify Technology SA, already Apple’s largest rival in paid music streaming, has spent about $400 million acquiring podcast companies. It’s also funded original shows from comedian Amy Schumer, journalist Jemele Hill and hip-hop artist Joe Budden. Earlier this year, it announced a deal to host podcasts from a company founded by former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.These moves have established Spotify as the clear No. 2 player in podcasting, according to industry executives. The company has seized between 10% and 20% of listeners, and accounts for half of the audience on some shows. Other companies, including IHeartMedia, Stitcher, Pandora and Luminary, have also devoted more resources to the medium.Apple is in the midst of building a suite of media services across audio and video that tether people to its phones and other devices. Podcasting is still a small business compared with music or TV. Podcasting companies generated $479 million in advertising sales in the U.S. last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Growing FastBut the industry has been growing. Sales have grown 65% a year for the past three years, according to the IAB, while the number of monthly listeners to podcasts has doubled over the past five years.Still, Apple doesn’t make its own money off of the Podcasts app. It doesn’t charge for the software or run its own advertising.However, growing the Podcasts app and adding exclusives could give some consumers another reason to stick to their iPhone or subscribe to complementary paid services like Apple Music. Apple also has an advertising division focused on ads in the App Store, which theoretically could eventually be applied to Podcasts if it continues to increase its user base.(Updates with Spotify shares in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.009,0.87,0.121,1

976,0.9898,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The venture-capital business is one marked by a fundamental asymmetry, says Scott Kupor, managing partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and this week's guest on Masters in Business: The average venture capitalist has done hundreds or maybe even thousands of deals; the typical entrepreneur is raising capital for the first time.This information and experience asymmetry creates issues, not only for the entrepreneur, who doesn't want to be taken advantage of, but also for the VC, who is concerned with finding and funding quality deals. Kupor, author of the new book &quot;Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital and How to Get It,&quot; describes the road map for startups that want to better understand the nature of venture capital. He explains the advantages that accrue to any founder who knows how to successfully navigate the perils and pitfalls of the capital-raising process.Kupor explains why Y Combinator and other seed funds were such game changers for start-ups. As entrepreneurs became more educated, the deal funnel and gate-keeper relationship that was previously controlled by a handful of connected VCs was altered. These changes were quite significant: Since 2005, Y Combinator has backed more than 2,000 startups with a combined valuation of more than $100 billion.The influence of venture capital on the U.S. economy is hard to overstate. Venture-backed companies now spend 44% of the entire research-and-development budget for public companies, and the 656 publicly traded businesses that were VC backed make up 20% of the total market capitalization of all public companies.Kupor's favorite books are here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Bloomberg, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Castbox, and Stitcher.

986,0.772,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Amazon.com Inc. faces a full-blown European Union antitrust probe as the bloc’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager prepares for a summer finale to her five-year crackdown on U.S. technology giants.The Dane, who heads the EU’s competition division, is poised to open a formal investigation into Amazon within days, according to two people familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because the process isn’t public.Vestager has hinted for months that she wanted to escalate a preliminary inquiry into how Amazon may be unfairly using sales data to undercut smaller shops on its Marketplace platform. By ramping up the probe, officials can start to build a case that could ultimately lead to fines or an order to change the way the Seattle-based company operates.“If powerful platforms are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,” said Johannes Kleis of BEUC, the European consumer organization in Brussels.The probe comes as Qualcomm Inc. could be hit with a second hefty EU penalty as soon as next week for allegedly underpricing chips to squeeze a smaller competitor. The U.S. chipmaker was fined last year for thwarting rival suppliers to Apple Inc. and has been the subject of on-and-off antitrust scrutiny since 2005.Vestager has already slapped Google with record fines and ordered Apple to repay billions of euros in back taxes. By taking on Amazon’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, Vestager is keeping up the pressure on big tech right to the very end of her mandate, due to expire in October.Amazon and the European Commission in Brussels both declined to comment on the plans to open the probe. Qualcomm representatives declined to immediately comment.Business ModelWhile it will be the first time the EU has directly targeted Amazon’s online retail business model, it’s the third time the company has been probed by the regulator, following tax and e-book investigations.Although Google has been fined once a year for the past three years, racking up 8.2 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in penalties, the Alphabet Inc. unit still faces early-stage inquiries into local business and jobs searches. Apple also has to contend with a complaint from Spotify Technology SA and Facebook Inc. is getting questions on how it uses and shares data from apps.To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Chapman at pchapman10@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.025,0.929,0.047,1

989,0.9489,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just what is AMS AG up to?On Monday, the supplier to Apple Inc. made a short-lived, 3.7 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) effort to snatch Osram Licht AG from private equity firms Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, which had sewn up a lower-priced takeover of the German lighting-maker earlier this month.The abortive effort will underscore investor concerns about the company’s strategy under Chief Executive Officer Alexander Everke. The former NXP Semiconductors NV executive has spent billions of dollars trying to position AMS to capitalize on demand for new sensing technology used in the iPhone’s Face ID recognition system. But after his three years at the helm, the stock is trailing peers Finisar Corp. and Lumentum Holdings Inc.The flirtation with Osram was short and not particularly sweet. At 5:52 p.m. in London, Bloomberg News reported that AMS had made an offer for the Munich-based firm, some 11 days after Osram’s board accepted the private equity firms’ 3.4 billion-euro bid. Within 15 minutes, the target released a statement confirming it had received a non-binding offer from AMS. The company dismissed “the probability of this transaction materializing as rather low.” By midnight, AMS declared it was ending the takeover talks.Maybe the approach was an attempt to get a closer look at Osram’s books, or its 3-D sensing technology. If it was, then full credit to the lighting giant for calling Everke’s bluff, since financing for AMS’s bid wasn’t yet fully in place. While Osram said it would let the bidder perform due diligence, it was quick to emphasize that it could only do so under strict conditions.If it was a serious bid, then AMS shareholders have every right to feel bewildered. The target largely operates in the slowing automotive market, so would have hardly offset stagnating smartphone sales. Concern that the company may be more open to outsized and strategically questionable dealmaking than investors assumed helped to push the stock down by as much as 4.6% on Tuesday morning.Everke would have been asking for a lot of faith from investors to finance the deal. The company was planning to sell new stock – but would still have been left with net debt equivalent to about 27 times this year’s predicted free cash flow. This would have tried investor patience, which has already been sorely tested. AMS has spent $2 billion over three years buying companies and expanding production capacity to secure a dominant position supplying components for 3-D scanners in the latest generation of iPhones, only for sales of the handsets to promptly slow. AMS shares are 66% below their 2018 peak.In 2017, Everke predicted 2019 sales would exceed $2.7 billion, with an Ebit margin of at least 30%. After scrapping its dividend and year-ahead guidance figures in May, analysts now expect the company to report a 10% Ebit margin on sales of just $1.9 billion.

990,0.891,"Executives from tech giants Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet's Google go before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel Tuesday to discuss competition in online markets.  The committee is likely to discuss antitrust probes of the four companies under way at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, as well as allegations that the companies seek to thwart nascent competitors.  Democrats, in particular, are expected to press Facebook about a proposed $5 billion settlement between the company and the FTC to resolve allegations that the company violated a 2011 consent agreement by inappropriately sharing information on 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.",0.028,0.839,0.133,1
991,0.9769,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. technology giants are headed for their biggest antitrust showdown with Congress in 20 years as lawmakers and regulators demand to know whether companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. use their dominance to squelch innovation.Executives from Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are set to appear Tuesday before the House antitrust panel, whose Democratic chairman is leading an investigation into the market power of the biggest tech companies and their effect on competition.The hearing harkens back to Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates’ appearance before the Senate in 1998 when Microsoft was the target of government scrutiny into its monopoly in computer operating systems. Two months later, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft that reined in its practices and nearly led to the company’s breakup.“This is really a deep dive by the committee to understand what’s going on in the tech sector, what needs to be done in terms of antitrust enforcement but also to understand better whether there is a need for change in the law,” said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the policy group Public Knowledge, who served in the Justice Department’s antitrust division under President Barack Obama.While the executives testifying Tuesday don’t have the star power of Gates, their appearance marks the first time the largest technology companies will face questions from lawmakers amid a rising chorus of criticism that they are violating antitrust laws. That was the same accusation leveled at Microsoft two decades ago.Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, who leads the antitrust panel, is bearing down on technology companies as antitrust enforcers prepare their own scrutiny of the industry. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust jurisdiction, have taken the first steps toward investigating conduct by the biggest companies, with the Justice Department taking responsibility for Google and Apple, and FTC overseeing Facebook and Amazon.For more: Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech AssaultTuesday’s hearing will focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. One of the key complaints from critics of the big tech companies is that they can use their power to thwart competition from smaller rivals. Academic research has shown a steady decline in business start-ups across the economy. One possible explanation is that rising market concentration across industries effectively shuts out entry by new businesses.While some barriers to competition are inherent in any business, the key question for the antitrust committee is whether and how dominant tech platforms can intentionally raise barriers to new entrants, said Michael Kades, the director of markets and competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.A report by the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center this year found that digital markets tend to be winner-take-all in which one firm comes to dominate. That creates an incentive for the companies to edge out new challengers that could threaten that dominance.Lack of competition can lead to reduced innovation, which harms consumers over time, according to the report. “The evidence thus far does suggest that current digital platforms face very little threat of entry and are negatively impacting investment in key digital areas,” it said.For more: YouTube’s Trampled Foes Plot Antitrust RevengeOne of the authors of the Chicago report -- Yale University economist Fiona Scott Morton -- will testify Tuesday. The company executives scheduled to appear are Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, Matt Perault, head of global policy development at Facebook, Amazon associate general counsel for competition Nate Sutton, and Kyle Andeer, vice president of corporate law at Apple.E-commerce trade association NetChoice, which includes Google and Facebook, will tell the committee a different story: The reach of tech platforms gives small businesses the opportunity to target large audiences of potential customers through digital advertising. Not long ago, their only choice was expensive advertising in a local newspaper or television station, the group said.“These platforms are helping small businesses the same way a large retailer operates as an anchor for a shopping center or mall,” Carl Szabo, vice president of NetChoice, will say, according to his prepared remarks. “The larger these platforms grow means the more customers small businesses can reach with better targeting and lower costs.”Sarah Miller, deputy director of Open Markets Institute, which advocates for aggressive antitrust enforcement, countered that tech platforms are harming entrepreneurs.“These companies were the darlings of most Democrats and now the dynamic has changed profoundly,” she said. “There is really a period of learning going on in Congress, with staffers, with the broader public, around the varying ways that all of these tech companies, these tech monopolies, are destructive.”To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.055,0.856,0.089,1
992,0.9967,"(Bloomberg) -- The company that brought you free digital maps and email wants to do the same thing for your drone.Wing LLC, an offshoot of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, on Tuesday unveiled a new app it calls OpenSky that it hopes will become the basis for a full-fledged air-traffic control system to manage the expected growth of this new class of flying devices.It’s been approved to manage drone flights in Australia, where it is free. Wing has been working on demonstration programs with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and is also holding discussions with other countries on getting its app approved, according to James Burgess, Wing’s chief executive officer.“This is Wing’s effort to try to make drone flying easier and safer for all operators,” Burgess said in an interview. “We envision a future where it’s easy to access the sky and all drone operators are collaborative, able to follow the rules and work within the constructs of whatever aviation regulation and rules are in place in a country.”Wing isn’t alone in attempting to create a system that helps drone operators plan flights, ensure they adhere to legal restrictions and prevent mid-air collisions. Numerous companies, such as AirMap Inc. and Iris Automation Inc., are developing similar products and have been conducting tests with FAA.But Wing, with its ties to the global data behemoth Google and its simultaneous attempt to create a vast drone delivery network, brings a new heft to the arena.For companies like Wing, Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air and scores of others seeking to use drones for deliveries, having a robust air-traffic system for small drones flying at low altitudes is critical. Their business model for robot-like devices zipping across the skies won’t work unless they can keep track of each other and avoid collisions.“It’s a fundamental part,” Burgess said. “Because, for Wing to do the advanced delivery operations and provide that service that we envision, drones will have to share the skies safely and be able to operate in a highly automated fashion while still being compliant and interoperable with everything around them.”Helping build the air-traffic system and inducing all drone operators to participate will help Google reach its goal.Both Burgess and Reinaldo Negron, who heads Wing’s drone air-traffic efforts, said they welcome participation by other companies. Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority has created a computer platform that will allow multiple competitors to provide a similar service as Wing.While the U.S. hasn’t finalized its drone air-traffic plans, officials have said that they anticipate a similar system. Unlike the air-traffic network for traditional aircraft, which is operated by the government, drone tracking and management will be done by private companies, the officials have said.The company has made 80,000 test flights using its OpenSky app in three continents. It is available to Australian users of Apple Inc. and Android operating systems. There is also a PC version.In its initial guise, it will be free to anyone. Burgess declined to speak about Wing’s future plans for whether the app would contain advanced features for which the company would charge a fee.So far, systems such as OpenSky allow users to plan a flight. The Australian app tells drone pilots whether a flight is legal and also provides notifications of no-fly zones, such as a sporting event.As more and more drones become equipped with tracking devices, such apps may become the underpinning of an air-traffic management system for low-level drone flights that uses computers to automatically keep flights flowing orderly.When civilian drones burst onto the scene several years ago, there were few limits on who could fly them and enforcement of aviation regulations was spotty. As their use has exploded, so have safety incidents and the FAA has gradually begun adding restrictions.NASA has been crafting a framework for how drone traffic could be monitored and the FAA is working on regulations to require that the devices send out some type of radio beacon that will identify them, both to prevent midair collisions as well as to ensure they aren’t used illegally.Wing in April was the first U.S. drone company to receive government approval as an airline. The delivery flights the company envisioned haven’t begun yet.To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.017,0.86,0.123,1

994,0.9617,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Foxconn founder Terry Gou never considered an independent run for Taiwan’s presidency, a spokeswoman for the electronics tycoon said, after Gou lost the nomination to lead the island’s opposition party into January’s election.Speculation that Gou will leave the Kuomintang to pursue leadership of Taiwan is a “fake issue,” his spokeswoman Amanda Liu said in a text message on Tuesday. Gou’s response comes one day after Han Kuo-yu, the firebrand mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, overcame Gou and three other candidates in the party’s presidential primary.Liu declined to elaborate further when asked if Gou still intended to seek Taiwan’s presidency in another capacity, leaving the door open to speculation that the tech tycoon -- who in June quit as chairman of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconn’s main listed arm -- would find another way to run in the election. A solo bid by Gou could have a significant impact on the outcome, likely siphoning votes from the KMT as it tries to unseat incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen.Shares of Hon Hai climbed as much as 2.8% to their highest in about two months as investors expect Gou to focus more on the company.Power BrokerThe 68-year-old is a major power broker in the global electronics industry, with unusually strong ties to both the U.S. and China. He built Foxconn Technology Group from a maker of television knobs into a global powerhouse that is now Apple’s largest supplier and China’s largest private employer, with as many as 1 million mostly migrant workers assembling everything from iPhones to Dell desktop computers.Earlier: China-Friendly Mayor Tops Foxconn’s Gou to Vie for Taiwan LeaderGou also has ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, agreeing to build a 13,000-worker facility in the state of Wisconsin in exchange for more than $4.5 billion in government incentives.Hailed by Trump as “one of the great deals ever,” the project has since been criticized for low-paying jobs and sudden dismissals.

1008,0.825,"Earning Season is coming. And this time, it might be a tough one, as more than 80 S&P; 500 companies have warned that second quarter earnings will likely be flatter than anticipated. Time Of The Season As we’ve said earlier Earning Call Season is when “a company’s management gets on a big, public conference call with analysts to answer questions about what’s in its quarterly earnings report and what’s going on with the profits, losses, and anything else that might move the stock.” (Not an analyst? Here’s some info on how to ask questions on a bunch of upcoming calls via Say.) Down Market These calls start this week, and for a number of reasons expect management to deliver bad news. Apple, who is just not having a great year, is expected to report a 14.7% decline in second quarter profit margins. Road and railway freight companies are generally considered the canary in the coal mine for growth, and unfortunately the trucking company JB Hunt is expecting profit growth of 1.7% this quarter, which is quite a drop from the 15.2% increase analysts expected only six months ago. All in all, this could be the biggest quarterly contraction in three years. But Why? Last year corporate earnings went through the roof because of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. That effect has largely worn off. While Trump’s tax cuts were helpful in making corporations richer, it would seem his tariff war is well on its way to undoing that growth. And China’s ongoing economic slowdown isn’t helping the situation either. It would seem that just like the Federal Reserve, companies everywhere are feeling a bit nervous about the state of the world.

1025,-0.5385,"(Bloomberg) -- Two key Republican senators pressed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Twitter Inc. decide what content appears on their social media platforms, calling the companies’ power a potential threat to democracy. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri made their demand in a letter sent to the FTC on Monday, a day before a hearing by a Senate panel into social media bias that will feature testimony from a top Google executive. The letter and hearing come just days after President Donald Trump aired similar grievances at a White House summit of conservative tech critics, fringe social media voices and GOP lawmakers including Hawley. “Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech,” the two Republican senators wrote in the letter, which Hawley’s office provided. “They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.”The request comes as Republicans increasingly allege that the companies engage in systematic anti-conservative bias, an unsupported claim. But the possibilities for abuse “are alarming and endless,” including potentially swaying elections, the senators said.Like Trump, both senators have been vocal about claims that social media silences conservatives. Cruz, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, is scheduled to hold a hearing Tuesday on Google’s “censorship.” The company’s global policy chief, Karan Bhatia, will testify, he said in a Monday opinion piece.“We go to extraordinary lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in such a way that political leanings are not taken into account,” Bhatia wrote in Fox News.All three companies have previously said they don’t make content decisions based on politics, though they have acknowledged occasional mistakes in taking down or limiting the reach of content or accounts of conservatives.“Importantly, these mistakes have affected both parties and are not the product of bias,” Bhatia wrote in his opinion piece. Spokesmen for Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on Monday.Cruz has said his views are based on anecdotes rather than rigorous data, which he blames on the opaque nature of the companies’ decisions regarding content.Hawley has previously proposed legislation that would require tech platforms to prove to the FTC that they’re politically neutral in their content decisions if they want to keep a key liability shield that protects them from lawsuits over content that third parties post on their platforms. Hawley was the featured speaker during Trump’s summit, during which the president called his bill “very important.”Almost 65% of Republicans or those who lean Republican believe big tech companies support liberal views over conservative ones, and 85% think it’s at least somewhat likely the companies are intentionally censoring political viewpoints, according to a Pew Research Center survey from last year.The FTC has authority to collect non-public information from companies and study matters related to competition and consumer protection, even if the issue isn’t related to a law enforcement matter. It has opened an investigation into how Internet service providers collect and use consumer data, and the agency has also started a task force to probe potentially anti-competitive conduct by tech giants.The Justice Department and FTC also have taken the first steps toward specific investigations of four big tech firms for antitrust violations. The Justice Department has taken responsibility for Google and Apple Inc., while the FTC will oversee Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.(Updates with Google response from fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from David McLaughlin.To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Linus ChuaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.064,0.876,0.06,-1

Then there were ongoing issues with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), that were raging until earlier this year when they were finally resolved. Both companies dropped all lawsuits involved at the time. But the combined volatility from all this uncertainty has provided investors multiple opportunities to go long over the past three years.Going forward, given the clarity the company now has with the Apple dispute done and over with, Qualcomm has the opportunity to return to being a stellar dividend growth stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips QCOM Stock and the Chip Sector Dividend YieldWhen looking at the major players in the chip sector, Qualcomm has the second highest dividend yield only to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy I think I'd give the edge to Qualcomm over Broadcom right now because of the fact that Broadcom is still digesting the nearly $19 billion CA Technologies acquisition that closed in November 2018.Symbol Company Dividend Yield AVGO Broadcom 3.7% QCOM Qualcomm 3.3% TSM Taiwan Semiconductor 3% MXIM Maxim Integrated Products 3% TXN Texas Instruments 2.6% SWKS Skyworks Solutions 1.9% ADI Analog Devices 1.9% MCHP Microchip Technology 1.6% STM STMicroelectronics 1.4% XLNX Xilinx 1.2% NXPI NXP Semiconductors 1% NVDA Nvidia 0.4% AMD Advanced Micro Devices NA Source: FinViz Increasing Cash Flows & Share RepurchasesAn attractive aspect for Qualcomm, as I mentioned above, is the fact the Apple dispute is over and the deal the two companies struck will allow Qualcomm to return to a point where they are generating higher cash flows than they are now.As you can see in the chart below, cash flows have been trending down for years as the saga has gone on and now I expect that trend will reverse.ZacksAn additional positive aspect for Qualcomm is they used a large portion of the cash they had accumulated to repurchase a massive amount of stock. Shares outstanding for Qualcomm are down nearly 18% year-over-year, which will help support future dividend growth. Technical Outlook for QCOM Stock  Click to Enlarge The technical outlook for Qualcomm is appealing because the stock is near the midpoint of the range that it has traded in this year. With the drop that occurred last week, shares are right near the 38.2% retracement level.In addition, many times when a stock has a large gap up, it will retrace and &quot;fill the gap.&quot;As you can see in the chart, shares of Qualcomm gapped up from $70 to $79 on April 17. The $70 level is right in the buy zone between the 50% level of $69 and the 38.2% level of $74 would be a quality entry point. Bottom LineThe bottom line for Qualcomm is cash flows should be increasing going forward. When the potential for increasing cash flows is combined with a significantly lower share count, Qualcomm can support a strong pace of dividend growth forward.

1036,0.9991,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors are giddy about Amazon.com Inc.’s fast-growing pool of advertising sales, which largely come from merchandise sellers buying commercial messages to make their goods more prominent on Amazon’s website.Calling this “advertising” is true, but also a misnomer that leads investors to imagine a Google-like marketing machine inside Amazon. It’s not – or not yet, at least. Amazon’s advertising is better understood as an additional tax the company imposes on the millions of businesses that sell through its vast digital mall. It’s one more toll extracted from sellers to access the fast lane of Amazon’s beautiful freeway for shopping.Ads may be a justified expense for merchants to access Amazon’s hundreds of millions of shoppers, and it’s a common business tactic to juice revenue. But it’s also risky for Amazon to milk its merchants for a higher effective commission than most businesses of its kind can command. And as regulators and politicians question whether the superpowers of U.S. tech are using their popular services to unfairly advantage themselves, Amazon may pay a cost in reputation the more it squeezes cash from its hold on online shopping. More than half the items bought on Amazon come from independent merchants that sell slacks or bocce sets through the e-commerce king. Amazon in some cases handles a lot of the leg work, in exchange for commissions and other fees. In recent years, Amazon has given those “marketplace” sellers and product manufacturers more options to buy Google-like advertisements, in part based on product searches, for an additional cost. Someone typing &quot;dog beds&quot; into Amazon’s search box, for instance, might first see results from the FurHaven brand or a merchant that resells pet products on Amazon, with an icon that notes those listings are “sponsored.” RBC last year estimated that about one out of every six product results on Amazon’s app was a sponsored listing. Products from companies without paid listings are pushed further down the page.As Amazon kicks off its annual Prime Day fake shopping holiday, it appears the company is offering even more paid product promotions. All those advertisements make up most of Amazon’s $11 billion yearly sales in a category that also includes fees for its branded credit cards. In my conversations with businesses that sell products on Amazon or advise merchants, there isn’t much hostility about Amazon charging them for promotion on top of other fees. Companies realize that paying to make their merchandise front and center on Amazon is a cost of doing business, and they generally say those paid placements generate enough sales to justify the expense. In a survey of businesses that sell on Amazon, the merchant services firm Feedvisor found three-quarters of respondents were satisfied with Amazon’s advertising platform. Ads, of course, also transfer money from merchants to Amazon’s wallet. The company on average takes about 26 cents of each dollar of transactions made by its marketplace vendors, according to Bloomberg Opinion estimates from Amazon’s disclosures. Add in an estimate of Amazon's revenue from the merchants’ advertising — which, again, is mostly an added fee paid by goods sellers and product manufacturers as a cost of doing business — and Amazon’s average haul per transaction likely tops 29 cents on each dollar.(2) In 2015, the company’s take was closer to 20 cents. Other marketplace businesses that connect sellers with customers — eBay Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Grubhub Inc., for example — tend to take an effective commission of 15% to 25% on each transaction, including advertisements if available.(3) Consider that some makers of apps, including Spotify and the company behind the the Fortnite video game, have complained that Apple Inc.’s up to 30% commission on transactions in its iPhone app store is far too high. Amazon itself doesn’t sell its e-books, movie downloads or other digital goods in the company’s iPhone apps, to avoid giving Apple a cut of 30 cents on every dollar — about what Amazon takes from its merchants.To be fair, Amazon is doing a lot of work for its cut of sales. It provides a vast customer base for merchants, often stores inventory for them and handles shipments, and takes responsibility for customer service and payments. That’s arguably far more work than Apple does for its 30% commission on a purchase of an iPhone game.(1) And all advertising is, in a way, a toll levied by a powerful distributor. Businesses buy ads on Facebook and Google to ensure their products and services don’t get drowned out by a sea of other information. Frito-Lay pays a supermarket extra to ensure its chips are on visible spots on shelves. Alibaba and eBay sell ads similar to those that Amazon offers to merchants. There’s nothing particularly unusual about what Amazon is doing in carving out room for merchants to market themselves, for a fee.But there is also something perverse about paying Amazon a kind of  tax to make sure your product is seen on Amazon, so people will buy the item on Amazon. Even Google’s ad empire isn’t this kind of a closed loop. And if one Amazon merchant doesn’t purchase an ad, one of its competitors’ dog beds — or Amazon's own brand — might instead nab an eye-catching display and wrest a sale instead. Amazon is just different, in a way that makes typical business tactics a little icky. Amazon’s growing cut from its merchants is one reason why the company's revenue is increasing more quickly than its merchandise sales. Amazon is extracting a bigger share for itself. Like other powerful tech companies, Amazon is able to charge more to the partners that rely on it, because they don't really have a choice. (Updates the “Take a Cut” chart to include an average effective commission for Airbnb instead of the high end of listed commission rates.)(1) This estimate is based on recent company disclosures that for the first time enabled calculations of the total value of goods sold on Amazon's digital mall. My calculation of Amazon's effective commission is the company's 2018 reported net revenue from commissions and other fees paid by marketplace vendors, $42.7 billion, out of roughly $166 billion in total merchandise sales made by those independent merchants. The effective commission including advertising is a rougher estimate, because it assumes 58% of Amazon's &quot;other&quot; revenue of $10.1 billion in 2018 -- primarily ads but also other services -- are paid listings purchased by Amazon's marketplace merchants. (That percentage corresponds to the merchants' share of total sales on Amazon.) The figure may overestimate Amazon's take from merchants, but probably not by much.(2) These companies’ effective take of transactions in some cases isn't entirely comparable to Amazon’s, because they do more or less work for their commissions and other fees. But they each get paid for their role as middlemen.(3) Earlier this year, my Bloomberg colleague Spencer Soper wrote about the mixed feelings among companies that sell on Amazon. Many of them find customers they couldn't have reached without Amazon, but some also grouse about the growing array of fees they pay the e-commerce giant or other downsides of selling goods there. Some merchants told Soper that Amazon is taking upwards of 40% of each sale.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Since then, it has embarked on numerous rallies and deep declines. The way the charts are setting up, a test of the prior highs or a run to new highs is certainly possible. Trading AmazonAs you can see on the chart below, the Amazon stock price breached the $2,030 level twice. These moves came in early September and early October, before cascading lower. Amazon stock bottomed out just above $1,300 in December, down more than 36% from its highs.

If the overall market can hold up, Amazon can continue to power its way higher. After all, its most recent earnings report in April was strong, it just happened to come right ahead of a major fall in the market.Those earnings results could give investors optimism for the upcoming report later this month, helping to bid shares higher ahead of the report. Further, Prime Day is just a few days away (starting on July 15th). That's an event investors are apparently buying ahead of, and it may set up for a sell-the-news situation as a result.The Prime Day catalyst could actually time up perfectly with a run up toward its all-time high at $2,050.50. If Amazon's rally sputters and pulls back ahead of earnings, it could be an opportunity for investors to buy the dip. That's particularly true if AMZN stock dips down to $1,950 and this level acts as support.Those are now the two levels to watch: $2,050 on the upside and $1,950 on the downside. Amazon vs. FAANGA few weeks ago when the S&P 500 was hitting new highs, the Nasdaq was not. We pointed out that it didn't have the participation from FAANG.Of the group, only Amazon was less than 10% off its all-time highs. In fact, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) were all at least 13% off their highs at the time.Even with Amazon carrying the load (along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been a beast) how long can the Nasdaq hit new highs without its biggest components doing better?For now, FAANG (minus AMZN) is still at least 7% off its all-time highs. Imagine the boost the Nasdaq would catch if big money started flowing back into these names again. In that case, imagine how well Amazon stock would do, given that it already has bullish momentum.FB and NFLX may be leading in year-to-date gains, but AMZN doubles the next best performer on the one-year timeframe.Simply put, this name is crushing its peers. Bottom Line on Amazon StockWith Prime Day approaching and the Nasdaq drifting higher, Amazon stock could continue to rally. A move up toward the $2,050 level may be met by sellers initially, but a pullback would all be too healthy for bulls. Particularly if they're optimistic ahead of earnings.The stock continues to perform well and is outrunning its FAANG peers at the moment. On July 11, for the first time in almost a year, Amazon stock topped a $1 trillion valuation.Long-term investors who like the name should take advantage of large swoons in Amazon. It dominates in various secular growth themes and has clearly positioned itself as a leader in tech.Its strong earnings growth (estimates call for 35% growth this year and 40% growth in 2020) makes the valuation more palpable. Even better? AMZN has been crushing earnings estimates over the last seven quarters, while its immense cash flow buoys any financial worries from investors.That said, we saw a 35%+ correction in Q4 and ~15% pullback in the month of May. These are the types of swoons to take advantage of for those looking for longer-term entries.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

It is slated to announce its second-quarter results  on Wednesday, July 17 after the market closes.Like the shares of many other tech companies, Ebay stock has been on fire. In 2019, eBay stock price has surged an impressive 43%. That is actually better than arch rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has gained about 34%.Yet until this year Ebay stock had been a laggard. For the past five years, eBay stock price has risen by an average of only 9.2%, versus the average 44% gain of AMZN stock over the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what can we expect from eBay earnings? For the top line, analysts, on average, are calling for an increase of 2.6%, while their consensus earnings per share estimate is 62 cents per share, up from 53 cents in the same period last year.  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week But Ebay earnings may actually get overshadowed next week because on July 15 and  July 16 Amazon.com will hold its mega sale, Prime Day.  That will definitely suck up a lot of the attention of business-news media outlets and of investors.Yet eBay will not sit idly by. The company has announced its &quot;Crash Sale&quot; program, which, according to eBay, is being held on July 15 in case Amazon's website crashes, as it did during  last year's Prime Day. To this end, eBay has put together a new website called &quot;The Brand Outlet,&quot; which has plenty of items from top brands like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, KitchenAid and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) with discounts of as much as 70%.According to eBay's VP and COO of the Americas, Jay Hanson: &quot;eBay is primed to deliver exactly what shoppers want during this year's crash (sale). July has become a massive shopping season, and our summer sales include blockbuster deals that will not disappoint.&quot;The company has made other moves that have helped to boost Ebay stock.  Here's a look at some of them:  * Over the past year or so, eBay has been transforming its marketplaces to improve users' experience. While the transition has been choppy, the long-term results should be positive.  Keep in mind that buyers have indicated that the new system is better and will encourage them to buy more products on eBay.  * eBay has launched a digital- ad business, enabling it to more effectively monetize its users.  * In early March, eBay launched a strategic review. This was the result of  pressure from activist investors Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value LP, which have both taken large stakes in eBay stock.  The firms now  have two seats on eBay's board between them. As part of the review, eBay will also explore other potential moves, including selling assets, such as the StubHub website and eBay Classifieds Group.  * eBay has announced that it plans to return $7 billion in capital back to the owners of eBay during the next two years. Given Ebay stock has a market cap of $34.6 billion, $7 billion is a sizable amount of money. The Bottom Line on eBay Stock PriceEven after the rally of Ebay stock, its valuation is still reasonable, as its forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average estimate,  is 13. By comparison, the forward PE ratios of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  and AAPL are 22 and 16, respectively.Granted, Ebay stock is still facing major risks. Its growth is uninspiring, as its gross merchandise volume fell 4% in Q1. And analysts don't think GMV rebounded  much in Q2. eBay also continues to have difficulties making inroads against Amazon.com.But the good news is that the company appears to be serious about getting things on track and is focused on increasing the value of Ebay stock, as seen by its responses to the requests of Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value. And besides, expectations for eBay's Q2 results are muted - and should be beatable.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

1044,0.9991,"(Bloomberg) -- Brian O’Kelley built AppNexus Inc. to help companies advertise anywhere on the internet. Its software plugged into virtually every digital ad-trading hub, including those from Google, the biggest ad seller, and Google’s YouTube video service. By 2014, AppNexus was valued at $1.2 billion.Then, in 2015, Google stopped letting companies buy ads on YouTube using outside software. The move got more marketers to use Google ad services. It also created a glaring hole for AppNexus: The startup could no longer give customers access to the largest supply of online video. It never really recovered.“They crushed our growth and ruined our product,&quot; said O’Kelley, who stepped down as AppNexus chief executive officer last year. YouTube represented a huge portion of the video inventory that AppNexus offered to advertisers. Those marketers couldn’t just ignore YouTube &quot;because it’s pretty much a monopoly in that space,&quot; he added. &quot;It’s not a supply-and-demand problem. It’s a ‘You just broke our entire business’ problem.’”The story is familiar to advertising and media entrepreneurs who built businesses around YouTube, only to be hobbled when the video giant changed the rules of engagement. Google used YouTube’s popularity to lure creators, media companies and tech firms onto the service, gaining access to more videos and ad space. YouTube then used that supply to control ad prices and amass data about viewers, squeezing out anyone that tried to compete, according to interviews with more than a dozen partners, rivals and former employees. Many asked not to be identified discussing sensitive information about a powerful industry player.YouTube didn’t wipe out competition in one fell swoop, or act maliciously, according to these people. Instead, YouTube made decisions to consolidate the video ad-buying process, with little regard for partners or competition, and few regulatory checks. That left a graveyard of failed companies in its wake and fewer choices for advertisers, the people said.In digital video advertising, YouTube has no peers. The U.S. market harnessed $16.3 billion in ad spending last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. YouTube accounted for the majority of that. Globally, the video giant generated $16 billion in 2018 sales, BMO Capital Markets estimates.YouTube disputes this depiction of its dominance. The company said it shares more than half its ad sales with video producers, and competes in a much bigger market than just online video ads. &quot;Viewers have never had more choice when it comes to where to watch their favorite videos,&quot; YouTube spokeswoman Andrea Faville wrote in an email. &quot;Similarly, advertisers have a wide and growing array of options, including traditional television, which still accounts for the majority of video ad spend.&quot;But U.S. regulators and politicians are now listening to claims that Google and YouTube may have run afoul of the law. The Department of Justice is considering an antitrust investigation of Google. The Federal Trade Commission is probing allegations that YouTube violated privacy laws protecting children, Bloomberg reported earlier this year. Congress, which has multiple investigations into Google and its peers, recently requested an interview with a former YouTube business partner, according to some of the people who spoke with Bloomberg.“If you’re looking into Google, it would be remiss not to look at YouTube,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy for Open Markets Institute, a think tank. “You’ve got monopolies upon monopolies.”YouTube may be preparing for scrutiny. Its executives recently reached out to partners to ask how its practices have affected their ad sales, according to one of the people who spoke with Bloomberg. YouTube did so as part of typical partner relationship management efforts, but this person interpreted the outreach as a sign of YouTube nerves about antitrust regulation.Vevo humbledFew companies show YouTube’s grip on the digital video market better than Vevo, which distributes music videos online from two of the three largest record labels.The company was conceived by Doug Morris, then head of Universal Music Group. Founded in 2009, Vevo collected music videos and original programming, and distributed those clips across the internet – on YouTube, on Yahoo and on Vevo.com. The ultimate goal was to turn Vevo’s site into the MTV of the internet and get higher advertising rates, Morris said.At a lunch with Morris, then Google CEO Eric Schmidt embraced the idea. Vevo could share ad revenue with the internet giant when Vevo clips ran on YouTube.As YouTube grew, though, the relationship frayed. Vevo music videos were popular on YouTube, and advertisers loved them. But YouTube couldn’t sell ads on these clips because Vevo had exclusive rights in every market where it operated. The Google unit set out to take control of this valuable inventory through aggressive contract negotiations, sneaky sales tactics and even an effort to buy its rival outright, according to the people who spoke with Bloomberg.In late 2012, YouTube proposed a new contract that would have allowed it to also sell ads on Vevo videos, and would have reduced Vevo’s share of the revenue from those ads. Google also offered to buy Vevo. When the record labels balked, YouTube said it would take down Vevo music videos before the existing contract expired, according to the people who spoke with Bloomberg.Vevo’s leadership called an emergency board meeting. The company stood to lose millions of dollars if it disappeared from YouTube, which then reached about 1 billion people a month and accounted for most of Vevo’s audience and sales.Vevo executives told YouTube they would file an injunction describing what they said was bullying tactics, and asking a judge to block the video giant from removing Vevo videos, according to former employees and music industry executives. The gambit worked. YouTube agreed to a new deal that let Vevo keep exclusive rights to its ad inventory.In July 2013, Google acquired a minority stake in Vevo. That didn’t give it full control, but offered more visibility into Vevo’s business.YouTube’s attempts to stifle Vevo continued, according to people familiar with the efforts. While it couldn’t access Vevo’s ad inventory, the video giant could reduce its influence, the people said.YouTube encouraged artists to go around Vevo by creating their own YouTube channels to replace the ones operated by Vevo, the people said. Faville, the YouTube spokeswoman, said the company encouraged artists to consolidate their presence on a single &quot;official&quot; channel to avoid confusion. &quot;This product change was a net benefit to fans and artists,&quot; she added.YouTube also flirted with the limits of its Vevo deal. Some of YouTube’s sales pitches to advertisers included the Vevo logo and artists such as Rihanna, according to people who saw the documents. The documents suggested that YouTube could run ads on Vevo videos even though YouTube was contractually prohibited from doing so. Vevo executives flagged the problem to YouTube executives, who apologized and blamed the sales team, the people said. Faville called this a one-time error.Vevo tried to send viewers to its own website and mobile app, but YouTube’s algorithms made that risky. The software recommended videos that were watched a lot on YouTube. If Vevo clips were seen elsewhere, those views were not counted by the Google unit. The result: Vevo videos didn’t perform as well on YouTube, according to industry executives. Faville said YouTube’s algorithms don’t factor whether videos direct viewers elsewhere.In 2018, Vevo stopped competing with YouTube for a large consumer audience, shutting its app and website, and cutting product and engineering staff. Around the same time, YouTube secured a deal that gave it what rivals say it wanted all along: the right to sell Vevo’s ads.In thinking about what went wrong, Morris remembers discussing Vevo with Steve Jobs. “Why won’t Vevo be worth billions?” he asked before the Apple Inc. co-founder died in 2011. Jobs said Google already effectively owned Vevo because YouTube had a lock on Vevo’s viewers. &quot;They’ll control it,&quot; Jobs warned, according to Morris.Once envisioned as a site that would compete with YouTube for views and ad dollars, Vevo is now mostly a logo with a small sales team.Machinima’s demiseMachinima Inc., like Vevo, started out as an asset for YouTube. In YouTube’s early days, it didn’t have an advertising sales team nor staff managing relationships with individual video creators. Machinima was one of the first companies to assemble a network of YouTube channels and creators. It sold ads on the channels’ behalf, struck deals with brands and developed YouTube stars, including PewDiePie, one of the most popular video bloggers. That success spawned clones, including Maker Studios, Fullscreen and AwesomenessTV. Known as multi-channel networks, or MCNs, they were seen as the cable networks of the future.But the relationship soured as MCNs got big enough to compete for ad dollars. YouTube executives didn’t want third parties getting in between viewers, video creators and advertisers, according to former MCN executives and employees. So YouTube made MCNs superfluous by replicating many of their offerings, while limiting their access to data and tools that would have helped them build their own businesses, these people said.In November 2013, YouTube instituted a policy that made it clear MCNs would need to look beyond YouTube if they wanted to thrive. The company said it would take 45% of ad sales from all partners on YouTube, up from the 30% it collected from some large media companies. Solo creators could survive on a 55% share, but the MCNs couldn’t support their growing staff and expansion plans.“These companies realized advertising sales weren’t enough,” said Peter Csathy, founder of advisory firm CREATV Media. “Too much of a share had to go to YouTube.” YouTube’s Faville said revenue sharing agreements with MCNs didn’t change.The MCNs tried using collective power to get more favorable terms. They wrote a letter asking YouTube to consider changes, but that went nowhere. Some MCN executives pitched their boards on going to the Justice Department to file an antitrust suit against YouTube, but directors refused to fund what would have been a long and expensive legal battle, according to people familiar with the deliberations.Relations between MCNs and YouTube deteriorated under Susan Wojcicki, who took over as chief executive officer of YouTube in 2014. The veteran Google advertising leader corralled the company’s huge digital sales force to focus more on YouTube. She also created Google Preferred, a package of the best-performing videos on YouTube that advertisers could buy.YouTube already sold more video ad space at attractive prices than any media company online. With Google Preferred, YouTube could also compete on quality. Google offered advertisers similar videos as Machinima at lower prices, with better targeting and more volume. YouTube had the relevant clips – and, with data from Google’s other popular services, it knew more about what viewers wanted to see. Smaller media companies like Machinima could not sustain their sales forces selling less-targeted ads at the lower rates offered by Google and YouTube.One by one, the MCNs either shrank, sold themselves or died. Earlier this year, Machinima laid off its remaining employees and ceased operations.AppNexus’s ordealBrian O’Kelley’s AppNexus had a similar experience. It flourished in a market that Google helped create: programmatic online advertising. For years, ads were placed with handshake deals between marketers willing to spend and websites willing to sell. With programmatic software, buying ads became more automated, effective, cheaper and faster. Several firms raised millions of dollars to pursue this opportunity. Rocket Fuel Inc., went public in 2013 valued at more than $2 billion. The Rubicon Project Inc. did an initial public offering in 2014, and AppNexus was tipped to follow.But in 2015, Google made a move that showed how powerful it was in this market. Google removed YouTube inventory from ad exchanges run by other companies including AppNexus. With a few exceptions, any advertiser that wanted to market on YouTube had to use Google’s software or ad exchange.Google saw a business rationale behind the decision. Outside exchanges handled less than 5% of YouTube’s ad slots at the time, according to the company. Also, YouTube’s most popular ad format -- a skippable one that ran before videos, called TrueView -- was &quot;not supported&quot; on external exchanges, YouTube’s Faville said. Keeping such a small slice of ads available to buyers through other exchanges wasn’t worth the extra work.However, O’Kelley and others in the ad-tech industry saw the move as a clear example of Google using YouTube’s assets to favor other parts of its business -- in this case, Google’s ad software -- at the expense of rivals. Five percent of YouTube ads may not be important for Google, but it’s a vast amount for smaller competitors.Dina Srinivasan, a former executive at ad agency WPP Plc, compared Google’s 2015 move to a company decreeing that investors can only trade popular shares on one stock exchange, and through one brokerage firm.Google ad prices are set in an auction and not public. But taking YouTube off outside exchanges probably reduced the number of marketers bidding on its ads, lowering prices, according to Srinivasan. “Google may have absorbed a loss in YouTube revenue for some other reason,” she added. “The question regulators will be asking is whether that reason was to drive out competition.”Despite a short-term dent in YouTube sales, the ploy likely increased the long-term value of Google by billions of dollars because it strengthened the company’s grip on advertising technology, according to O’Kelley. &quot;That’s kind of how monopolies roll,&quot; he said.There’s a “no economic sense” test in U.S. antitrust law that may apply here, according Srinivasan. The Justice Department’s top trustbuster Makan Delrahim discussed this in a recent speech about big tech companies. When oil refineries refused to sell themselves to Standard Oil in the late 19th century, the giant cut prices to drive them out of business. Lower prices are the essence of competition, but a powerful company is not allowed to do things that make no business sense just to make it harder for rivals to catch up, he said.YouTube said its tactics were sensible. &quot;Like any business, we make changes to how we operate to reflect the current climate,&quot; Faville said. &quot;We make all these decisions with the same goal: to improve the YouTube experience for our users, creators, and advertisers.&quot;Since Google changed the YouTube ad-buying process, much of the rest of the programmatic market has withered: Rubicon Project is trading about two-thirds below its IPO price; Rocket Fuel Inc.’s valuation fell below $100 million before it was acquired. The AppNexus IPO never happened and it sold to AT&T Inc. last year for $1.4 billion. The Trade Desk Inc. is a rare thriving player, but it operates in China and other markets where Google is less active.In 2016, several ad tech companies, including AppNexus, met with Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to discuss the industry, and some complained about YouTube’s behavior, according to O’Kelley. The response was tepid at best, he said.“We had a really hard time getting them to pay attention,&quot; O’Kelley recalled. &quot;They would say, ‘It’s hard to understand.’&quot; A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment, and the Department of Justice didn’t respond to a request for comment.But now, O’Kelley may have a more attentive audience. In May, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on digital advertising. &quot;This is not a functioning market,&quot; he said. &quot;It enables Google, which doesn’t produce content, to monopolize all aspects of the programmatic business and take a disproportionate tax for its trouble.&quot;Later, over the phone, O’Kelley was less grim about the political response. &quot;Maybe now they’re paying attention,&quot; he said.To contact the reporters on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net;Mark Bergen in San Francisco at mbergen10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Emily BiusoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.045,0.862,0.093,1

1046,0.9865,"In the latter part of 2018, bearishness took hold of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and sent shares to the $150 range as AAPL stock investors took in the news that the company would no longer issue unit sales numbers for its iconic iPhone device.Source: Shutterstock CEO Tim Cook reasoned that subscription and app sales mattered more for profitability. By that logic, Apple could afford to offer less transparency into its business each quarter. Now that the shares have recovered, there are three reasons investors should buy Apple stock. Weaker iPhone Sales ExpectedInvestors have had more than six months to accept that unit sales for iPhones will fall. Average selling price (ASP) is significantly higher with each successive release of the device. And although loyal customers will hold off upgrading to the latest iPhone, their device will stay in the iOS ecosystem. Even if revenue falls, Apple will enjoy healthy profit margins from sales of iPhone 8, X, XR, and XS Max.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExpect the total profit per user to hold steady or increase, driven by more customers signing up for Apple Music. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had 28 million subscribers, 2 million more than Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). SPOT stock trades at similar price/sales and price/book multiples compared to Apple. Yet Spotify's price/forward cash flow multiple is 75, compared to 20.5 times for Apple.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 Don't forget that Apple recently launched its News App. By sending notifications for timely news, users who use the app often may end up subscribing to the service. In doing so, they get Apple News Plus, which gives users access to premium newspapers and more than 300 digital magazines.  Look for Earnings Beat on July 30When Apple reports quarterly earnings on July 30, the company may beat the Q2/2019 EPS estimate of $2.12.Source: TipranksLast year, Apple reported earnings of $2.34, topping the $2.17 estimate. Strong revenues are possible because Apple Music subscription growth is gaining momentum. The iPad and iPad Mini refresh could drive device sales higher. Conversely, the iPad Pro faces stiff competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface book and Surface tablet. Still, Apple has the AirPod, Watch, and HomePod to offset a drop in Pro sales.In the unlikely scenario that AAPL stock falls after reporting strong results, the drop gives investors a chance to average down. Most who invest in Apple are in it for the long term. Viewing short-term drops in the stock as entry points played out well in the last decade.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown To be sure, weak iPhone sales could spook investors and send Apple stock lower. Yet if consumers are simply holding off on upgrades in general, Apple is not losing market share. So if users are not leaving the iOS ecosystem for Android, Apple subscription and software sales will return high profits. Service Revenue Will Drive GrowthThe second quarter 2019 saw Apple report its best quarter ever for Services, as revenue topped $11.5 billion. Even as worldwide iPhone revenue fell 17%, Services grew to new heights, with more than 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, up 30 million in the last quarter. During 2020, Apple expects to surpass 500 million subscriptions.That is a phenomenal rate of growth. And the strong uptake of Services will include growing App sales. In Q2, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40%. Apple has a well-diversified source of revenue from apps; the biggest third-party subscription app accounted for just 0.3% of its total Services revenue.Apple forecast revenue of $52.5 billion - $54.5 billion for the upcoming report for the June quarter. Gross margin will be around 38%. Operating expenditures will be $8.7 billion - $8.8 billion. Your Takeaway on AAPL StockApple is confident about the growing revenue from the product category level. More importantly, it expects iPhone sales improving Y/Y in the upcoming Q3 report. Cash flow generation is so strong that AAPL stock repurchase authorization and its quarterly dividend. A dividend hike is unlikely but if Apple does so, look for Apple stock continuing its uptrend.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1047,0.9994,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The share of income and wealth going to the so-called “1%” has incensed protesters and agitated economists around the world. From the Occupy Wall Street movement to the work of academics such as Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman, attention has zeroed in on what the super-rich earn and own, and on how governments should use taxes for redistribution.Such policy ideas have taken center stage in the primaries of the U.S. Democratic Party, which decide who will challenge President Donald Trump in 2020. One of the runners, Senator Elizabeth Warren, advocates a 2% wealth tax on fortunes above $50 million. She has found unlikely billionaire allies, including the investor George Soros and Facebook Inc.’s co-founder Chris Hughes, who say they’d accept a levy on their riches to “help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes.”These are all smart people but there’s a danger they may be missing something here. The French economist Philippe Aghion points out that there’s a direct correlation between high levels of inequality in favor of the top 1% and innovation (the creation of new technologies). Given that every country is eager to foster innovation – because it brings huge economic benefits – might there be an argument that a concentration of wealth at the top isn’t necessarily a great evil?Aghion’s view is that instead of seeking to punish the 1%, the main priority for governments should be to ensure that the top strata of the wealthy isn’t allowed to remain a closed shop – that is, new innovators must be free to challenge and replace incumbent companies. Given the entrenched positions of giant technology companies such as Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., this is going to need a bit of work.The London School of Economics professor, who presented his findings in Paris last month, also said there was no evidence that faster innovation would produce more inequality further down the income scale. This is only about the difference between the 1% and the rest. And he said increases in innovation were linked to better social mobility. Aghion believes that new inventions give people the chance to rise up the ladder faster.Indeed, mobility (admittedly at the top end) is the prime motivation for all those technology pioneers in the first place. They want to make enough money to join the ranks of the very wealthiest. Aghion’s conclusion, in line with the tradition of the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, is straightforward: Companies come up with new processes and products to generate and appropriate “rents.” Governments shouldn’t target these extra profits excessively since it would stifle the desire to innovate.This doesn’t mean there’s no role for public policy. Quite the opposite. Aghion also showed how all is not well in innovation-land. The growth rate of total factor productivity, a measure of efficiency, rose sharply in the 10 years after 1996 but then declined. In particular, productivity growth among tech companies and firms that are the biggest technology users appears to have peaked respectively in the mid-1990s and in the mid-2000s, and has slumped subsequently.Meanwhile, as the academics Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout have shown, companies are becoming ever more able to charge markups in excess of their costs. Yesterday’s innovators are enjoying a quietly untroubled and lucrative life today, which may well be down to the barriers to entry they themselves have erected.While many on the left hanker after higher taxes to shrink the share of income and wealth of the 1%, it’s not even clear that they’re an effective tool. Aghion looked at the tax reforms introduced by the French president Francois Hollande in 2012, including a 75% tax on earnings above 1 million euros. He found that the changes prompted more of the ultra-rich to leave France but that any improvement in social mobility – measured as the number of people who have moved upward in the bottom 95% of the income scale between 2011 and 2015 – was extremely limited (although it’s too soon to draw strong conclusions).So if we want to encourage the bursts of innovation that actually support genuine upward mobility, tackling the quasi-monopolistic practices of the biggest companies might be a better use of political energy. For years, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook  Inc., Google and their ilk have been subject to relatively little antitrust scrutiny. This may be changing: The European Union has fined Google three times for a total of about 8.2 billion euros ($9.3 billion) for abusing its dominant position. There are signs too that U.S. antitrust authorities are finally waking up to this problem.Of course, proponents of higher taxes on wealth and income believe they can foster competition and social mobility. If they fund improvements in education, such thinking goes, that may help today’s poor become tomorrow’s champions. But France’s experience in 2012 poses questions about how much can be raised before wealthy individuals move abroad. In the U.S. there’s a vocal debate over how much Warren’s wealth tax would actually bring in.The rise of left-wing politicians such as Warren and Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn suggests a hunger among younger voters for much greater redistribution. While higher taxation may make the world fairer, there’s little evidence it will make the economy innovate more or grow faster. Robust competition enforcement is a better answer. Before you bash the rich, try busting the trusts.To contact the author of this story: Ferdinando Giugliano at fgiugliano@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Ferdinando Giugliano writes columns on European economics for Bloomberg Opinion.

1056,0.9951,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. officials approved a record $5 billion privacy settlement with Facebook Inc. to resolve the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, people said, prompting an immediate outcry from lawmakers and privacy advocates who said it didn’t go far enough.Although details of the settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission weren’t announced, the fine is steep but far from devastating for Facebook. The company, which reported revenue of almost $56 billion in 2018, had set aside $3 billion in anticipation of the fine.“This reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who called for a hearing on the agreement. “Such a financial punishment for purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year,” Blumenthal said.The FTC’s settlement was approved by a vote of 3-2, according to two people who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the decision. The agreement still needs approval from the Justice Department.The resolution caps a probe that opened in March 2018 after news that Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm hired by President Donald Trump’s campaign, obtained user data from a researcher who created a personality quiz app on the social network.The settlement is the largest privacy fine in the FTC’s history and also marks the most significant action yet against Facebook over a series of mishaps that have compromised users’ data and sent the company reeling from one crisis to another. The agency’s two Democratic commissioners, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, voted against it, according to one of the people.Slaughter, Chopra, Facebook and the FTC declined to comment.Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Warner of Virginia also criticized the settlement, as did House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is conducting an antitrust investigation of Facebook and other technology giants.The job of defending the settlement will fall to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, who has tried to avoid split enforcement decisions as head of the agency.While Facebook had agreed to give its board oversight of its privacy policies, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is the controlling board member with nearly 58% of the voting power. The board also includes Facebook’s other top executive, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The two already have power over the company’s privacy policies.Public interest groups including Public Knowledge, Public Citizen and the Open Markets Institute said any deal with the FTC should impose remedies that would rein in Facebook’s data collection practices in addition to a fine.“Something clearly has to be done to strengthen the data protection practices of that company,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which filed a complaint against Facebook that led to the FTC’s 2011 consent decree with the social-media company that addressed a litany of deceptive practices.Tech industry group NetChoice praised the fine, saying it would motivate companies to improve their privacy practices.The Cambridge Analytica incident stems from a personality-quiz app offered to Facebook users by a Cambridge University researcher. About 270,000 people downloaded the app, allowing the researcher to access data about those individuals and their friends. The information was subsequently sold to Cambridge Analytica.Even as it resolves the FTC privacy inquiry, Facebook is still grappling with regulatory scrutiny on several other fronts -- including the prospect of a new investigation by the FTC’s antitrust section under an agreement with the Justice Department that divided oversight of four of the biggest tech companies. One area of focus is likely to be the company’s acquisitions of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the Whatsapp messaging service.Elsewhere in the U.S., the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Separately, the attorney general for Washington, D.C., has sued the company, claiming it failed to safeguard users’ data. Other state attorneys general are also investigating.Facebook declined to comment on the status of those probes.The settlement ranks among the highest at the FTC, which reached a $10 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG in 2016 for deceptive advertising in the emission-cheating scandal involving diesel models. The agency’s previous record fine in a privacy action came in 2012, when Alphabet Inc.’s Google paid $22.5 million to settle claims it misrepresented its privacy assurances to Apple Inc.’s Safari users.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner and Naomi Nix.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Daniel Stoller in Arlington at dstoller1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.056,0.816,0.128,1

1071,0.9951,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reports its second-quarter earnings on July 17 after the bell. This will be the company's first earnings report since completing the purchase of Red Hat. For this reason, many investors may look for clues as to whether this acquisition can help resume growth and reverse the revenue declines that have led to an overall decrease in IBM stock over the last few years.Source: Shutterstock Although earnings reports tend to tell what happened in the past, investors need to go into this report focused on the future. Watch Revenues, GuidanceConsensus IBM earnings estimates for the quarter stand at $3.07 per share. If this number holds, it will come in one penny per share less than the second quarter of 2018, when the company earned $3.08 per share. They also forecast revenues of $19.16 billion, 4.2% less than the $20 billion earned in the same quarter last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough the Armonk, New York-based IT giant usually beats earnings estimates, the company fell short on revenue in the first quarter. Revenue growth has become an ongoing challenge as none of its divisions registered revenue growth in the previous report. Hence, analysts will probably watch this report carefully on revenue guidance.With revenue disappointing, earnings growth also becomes a struggle. IBM may avoid a drop in profits. However, analysts only forecast an earnings increase of 0.7% for the year.  * 10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why)  IBM's Position in the Market Remains UncertainThis makes the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around ten much less appealing. Also, its annual dividend yields almost 4.6% and has increased for 19 consecutive years. However, with the payout ratio now at over 66%, one has to wonder how long the dividend increases can continue for IBM stock if its negligible profit growth does not improve.Also, the company recently completed its acquisition of Red Hat. However, only time will tell whether that will help make the venerable IT giant successful in today's tech world. IBM has existed since 1911. It also managed to remain relevant long after its original technology became obsolete.However, the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have now passed the company by to a significant degree. With this challenge, one has to wonder whether IBM can successfully reinvent itself again. IBM Stock Is 'Speculative'This makes IBM stock something you would not normally associate with a large, profitable company -- speculative. It is a different kind of speculative than a penny stock hoping to make it back. In this case, IBM bulls hope the company can do well enough to maintain itself and its annual dividend increases.If Red Hat integration and other initiatives can resume significant growth rates for the company, IBM stock is very cheap at these levels. However, if anemic growth forces the company to end its 19-year streak of dividend increases, stockholders will probably face years of pain. The Bottom Line on IBMGoing into earnings, IBM stock investors need to watch guidance. Given its history, I think IBM will beat earnings. However, revenue declines and a high dividend payout ratio should cause concern.Hopefully for IBM stock bulls, revenue guidance will offer some hope, both for the integration of Red Hat into the company and for the resumption of revenue growth.To be sure, the low price-to-earnings ratio and the high dividend yield in a company with a history of payout increases could attract bargain hunters. However, these supposed benefits hide serious dangers. If the company fails to reverse revenue declines, a cut in payouts remains a real possibility.Hence, I think investors should avoid this stock going into earnings. Moreover, unless and until revenue looks poised to improve, I would treat IBM as speculative.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The company has enough net cash to essentially acquire any company in the world. But, the list of companies Apple should buy is short.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Indeed, I think it as short as seven companies. Thus, let's take a look at seven companies that Apple should buy as it aims to be net cash neutral over the next few years. Netflix (NFLX)The most obvious M&A use of Apple's huge net cash balance is an all-in acquisition of streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Source: Shutterstock No one can really deny the momentum that Netflix has by simply being the brand name in the streaming market. Nor can they deny the huge potential of that market, as the world increasingly cuts the cord and pivots to streaming, or the competitive moat that Netflix has established through quality and diverse original content.Because of these three factors, Netflix promises to be a big growth company for a lot longer. Apple could use that growth. As the hardware business dries up, the company is doubling down on the software business, and that reportedly includes a big dive into streaming and original content.Netflix would give Apple a head-and-shoulders leader in that market. Apple can also afford that growth. Netflix is a $150 billion company. Some cash and some debt could easily fund this acquisition.Overall, Netflix is a highly attractive target for Apple as the latter pivots toward creating software services to monetize the install base. Spotify (SPOT)If Netflix is a &quot;reach for the stars&quot; acquisition, then Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is a much more grounded acquisition target with still promising upside potential.Source: Spotify Spotify is trying to do in the streaming music market what Netflix did in the streaming video market. Granted, there's no original content, so the moat is much smaller. Also, Apple Music is a thing, and it has already dethroned Spotify in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Thus, this acquisition doesn't provide as much firepower or unique assets as a Netflix acquisition.But, it's also much cheaper, at just $20 billion. It would also give Apple complete control over the streaming music market, a position that AAPL could use to its advantage down the road through exclusivity agreements and price hikes. Plus, as mentioned earlier, Apple is pivoting big time into the software side of its business. Spotify fits right into that wheelhouse.  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: The Race for 1 Intensifies Overall, Spotify is a good acquisition target for Apple because the latter needs mobile software growth to offset plateauing hardware growth, and Spotify gives them just that. Disney (DIS)Apple wants to get into the streaming and original content market. But, in order to be successful in that market, Apple needs content. Right now, the company doesn't have any. But, Disney (NYSE:DIS) has a bunch of it, and all those content assets are arguably very undervalued today.Source: Baron Valium via FlickrDisney is a global media company with a brand name that is second to none. The company owns perhaps the most valuable content assets in the world, and between Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar movies, the company dominates the box office every year.The problem with Disney is that, as the world has pivoted to streaming, the company has been slow to catch on, and post box-office content distribution hasn't kept up with the times.Apple is unparalleled in terms of its digital reach to the consumer. Between iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches, most U.S. and global consumers have some digital connection point with Apple.Thus, it should be easy for Apple to push a streaming service (like Disney+ for example). But, AAPL needs the content. Disney has the content, and for only $170 billion (that includes the highly lucrative parks and box office businesses).Overall, Disney is an attractive acquisition target for Apple because, together, the two companies could create a very good streaming service that is rich with content and very easy to access. Tesla (TSLA)A lot of investors and analysts are saying that Apple's last truly revolutionary product was the iPhone, and that here hasn't been a breakthrough product ever since. Now, with the iPhone growth cycle on its last legs, those same analysts and investors are saying that Apple desperately needs to find that next breakthrough product before time runs out.Source: Shutterstock Let's say hello to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). This is a breakthrough company with not just one, but a portfolio of breakthrough products. That portfolio today includes the Model S, Model X and Model 3. Down the road, it will include many more Tesla vehicles, all of which share the same core electric powered characteristic.The benefits to Apple of such an acquisition would be enormous. Apple has been reportedly working on a car for a long time now, but this project hasn't materialized anything substantial to date. Acquiring Tesla would give Apple broad exposure to the auto market.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Plus, Apple could easily incorporate and integrate its numerous consumer-facing hardware and software products more seamlessly into Tesla vehicles. The benefits therein to both Tesla's auto business and Apple's services business would be huge.Overall, Apple should buy Tesla because Apple needs a breakthrough hardware product to replace the iPhone, and Tesla gives them a portfolio of breakthrough hardware products while also providing synergies with the services business. Shopify (SHOP)One of the markets in which Apple has a small presence today is e-commerce. But, Apple has all the resources to make a big play in the e-commerce market. If AAPL does that, a natural first step would be the acquisition of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).Source: Shopify via FlickrShopify provides e-commerce solutions for retailers of all shapes and sizes. Essentially, the company helps anyone and everyone create an e-commerce business.This is a big growth market because: 1) e-commerce is only growing in adoption, and 2) as e-commerce grows in popularity, more retailers will shift toward digital, and the e-commerce market will become increasingly decentralized and less consolidated.As such, over the next several years, I predict a majority of e-commerce dollar volume will flow through Shopify-powered stores.Thus, Shopify has all the e-commerce merchants and transactions. Apple creates a majority of the hardware products that enable those transactions.A marriage of these two companies would make perfect sense. Apple would control the whole e-commerce process, and could adapt the iOS ecosystem so that it works seamlessly with Shopify-powered stores, thereby ushering in an era of truly friction-less e-commerce.Overall, if Apple is looking to make a play in the red-hot e-commerce market, a natural first step would be to acquire Shopify, a company that would give Apple access to a large volume of e-commerce merchants and transactions. iRobot (IRBT)Going back to the &quot;Apple needs a breakthrough hardware product&quot; theme, a less expensive way to accomplish this than buying Tesla, is to buy iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT).Source: Shutterstock iRobot is a $2 billion company that is known for its robotic vacuum cleaners, Roomba. Roomba has been a huge success for iRobot as the robotic vacuum market has gradually gained traction over the past several years, and this has powered big gains in revenues, profits and the stock.But, Apple isn't interested in a robotic vacuum cleaner. That's too small of a product to move the needle. But, Apple should be interested in the entire consumer robotics space. For iRobot, robotic vacuum cleaners are just the tip of the iceberg.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Over the next several years, you will see robotic lawnmowers, robotic window cleaners, robotic car washers, robotic chefs, so and so forth. In sum, all these consumer robotics products provide a huge long-term opportunity. If Apple were to couple its resources and experience with iRobot's leadership position in this market, the two could create an immensely valuable consumer robotics company with multiple breakthrough automation products that become household norms over the next several years.Overall, iRobot is an attractive acquisition target for Apple because, for just $2 billion, Apple could gain entry into what could be a very large consumer robotics market that is still in the early stages of hockey stick growth. Roku (ROKU)The last entry on this list may surprise people. After all, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Apple are essentially competitors in the streaming device market. But, the synergies of an acquisition far outweigh the costs.Source: Shutterstock Despite Apple's best attempts in the streaming device market, the lion's share of this market still belongs to Roku. The company controls roughly 40% of the streaming device market, and 25% of the smart TV market. Thus, Apple trying to beat Roku in this market, while possible, is an uphill battle.Instead, Apple should just buy Roku. AAPL could absorb the entire streaming player and platform businesses into its own ecosystem, and put other competitors in this market, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), at a huge disadvantage. Buying Roku would also be pretty cheap (sub-$5 billion market cap), and it would give Apple wider reach to push a potential streaming service down the road.Overall, as opposed to trying to squash Roku, Apple should just buy them, and create a streaming platform business that is unrivaled in terms of reach and scale.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, NFLX, DIS, TSLA, SHOP, ROKU, AMZN and GOOG.

1081,0.9975,"Next Thursday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will announce its fiscal fourth-quarter results. The earnings looks poised to be rather important. After all, Microsoft stock has been on a nice bull run, with the shares up about 36% for the year so far, putting its market cap at a staggering $1 trillion. In 2019, MSFT stock has performed better than various other mega tech names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Source: Shutterstock But could analysts' Q4 estimates for MSFT be too high,  in light of the strong performance of Microsoft stock?  They actually look fairly reasonable.Consider that analysts, on average, are forecasting 9% growth on the top line to $32.8 billion and earnings per share of $1.21, up about 7% year-over-year. So analysts expect MSFT's top-line growth to decline  from the prior quarter, when its revenues climbed 14%. The fact is that it's getting tougher for MSFT to grow rapidly because its cloud business is getting more mature.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Note that there was a lot of Microsoft news last quarter. Here's a look at some of the highlights:  * MSFT and Sony (NYSE:SNE) are tough rivals. But they are willing to cooperate when there is an opportunity to make money. So the companies have become partners, as MSFT will integrate its systems into Sony's massive sensor business. The deal should help keep up the momentum of MSFT's cloud business. As for SNE, it will benefit from MSFT's extensive AI capabilities.  * Interestingly enough, MSFT launched a partnership with another long-time rival - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). That alliance appears to be  a shot at Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud business. The deal will allow result in the seamless integration of workloads between MSFT and ORCL's platforms.  * At the MSFT Build conference, the company issued many new announcements. As should be no surprise, there was a big focus on the company's cloud hosting platform and its AI.  MSFT highlighted  a few updates for Office 365, including an AI-powered grammar system.  * MSFT teamed up with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to leverage blockchain. The focus will be on helping JPM's clients better use this technology.  * At the E3 conference, MSFT provided details on 60 of its upcoming games - like Halo Infinite and Gears 5 -- as well as the next Xbox, which is expected to launch during the 2020 holiday season. The company also announced its cloud gaming service, xCloud.   The Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe valuation of MSFT stock is far from cheap. Consider that the forward price-earnings multiple of Microsoft stock is 27. The dividend yield is also a meager 1.33%.But MSFT stock deserves a premium, as the company has returned to its winning ways. MSFT has retooled its legacy Office and Windows franchises. Its bold acquisitions, including its purchases of LinkedIn and Github, have enabled MSFT to enter new markets.And more importantly, MSFT's fast-growing cloud business has been quite successful, as it is now the clear number two in the industry. In fiscal Q3, the revenue of its cloud unit spiked by 73%.And finally, the company is also a huge generator of cash, which allows it to continue making investments, acquisitions and buybacks. In other words, when it comes to next week's earnings report, it's a good bet there won't be negative surprises for the owners of Microsoft stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

1092,0.9978,"Shares in Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) have had a successful run year-to-date. Roku stock is up three-fold, from approximately $32 a pop in January to over $103 today. Despite competition from larger peers Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), investors are confident in the company's long-term success.Source: Shutterstock But with the Roku stock price reaching frothy valuation levels, future upside is likely limited. Read on to see why now is not the time to dive in. The Roku Platform Continues to GrowBased on Q1 2019 results, Roku continues to grow as a leading streaming platform. The number of active accounts is up 40% year-over-year, with 29.1 million active accounts in the first quarter of 2019. That compares favorably to the 20.8 million accounts in Q1 2018. Streaming hours have jumped 74% year-over-year, and average revenue per user has climbed 27%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith this subscriber growth, quarterly sales have climbed 51% YOY, from $61.5 million to $206.7 million. However, due to the increased expansion of its infrastructure, the company continues to post operating losses.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Losses from operations were $10.7 million, compared to a $6.9 million operating loss in Q1 2018. The company's 2019 guidance projects net revenues between $1.03 billion and $1.05 billion. However, management estimates a $65 million to $75 million net loss in 2019, with adjusted EBITDA estimated around breakeven ($10 million to $20 million).With ROKU continuing to invest in growth, it will be years before it becomes a &quot;cash cow.&quot; But today's performance is not the story. Besides the potential catalyst of formidable market share in the next five to ten years, investors believe the company to be an irresistible takeover candidate for deep-pocketed competitors. Is Roku Stock Still a Takeover Candidate?Due to its small size compared to peers, several analysts consistently consider Roku stock a takeover candidate.As InvestorPlace contributor Bret Kenwell discussed back in March, Alphabet is the most logical buyer. Kenwell pointed out that 70% of streaming users have a ROKU device. In contrast, only 16% of streamers own Chromecast, Alphabet's streaming media adapter.Acquiring the company would be a quick and easy way for Google to jolt ahead of Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the potential acquisition price is high, building out organically would cost money, and more importantly, time.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is another logical buyer. Microsoft has an existing streaming platform (Microsoft Movies & TV), but only Xbox users largely advantage this service. Buying Roku would get Microsoft's streaming and VOD service into more homes. That would give the software giant an opportunity to catch up to Amazon and Apple.And a slew of other potential acquirers abounds. Last October, InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth gave a full list of potential buyers. These include telecom companies such as AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ), as well as content behemoths such as Disney (NYSE: DIS). Even Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is a potential buyer.But takeover rumors are just that: rumors. Buying shares on takeover talk rarely pans out to big returns.An important caveat is valuation. When the Roku stock price was a third of what it is today, the company was more digestible. But at the current valuation, even a large competitor must weigh the opportunity cost of developing their own platform versus bulking up via a costly acquisition. Valuation: Roku Stock Price Getting FrothyGiven that Roku's biggest peers are subsidiaries of tech giants, the company's main publicly traded peer is Netflix. Looking at the company's enterprise value-to-sales (EV/sales) metric, Roku stock is the more expensive of the two. Specifically, that's 14.2 versus 10.5 for NFLX.The company also trades at a massive EV/sales premium to larger peers AMZN (EV/sales of 4.2), AAPL (EV/sales of 3.74) and GOOG (EV/sales of 4.86).It is important to note this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. As the only &quot;pure play&quot; of its kind, the company could be worth the premium. But with high expectations baked into the share price, the stock may no longer be a strong opportunity. Despite a Strong Business, Roku Stock Is Not a BuyDespite having less prestige than its FAANG competitors, Roku continues to grow as a major streaming platform. With advertising revenue moving from television to streaming, the company could win big long-term.But despite strong forward-looking prospects, ROKU stock is not a buy at these levels. Investors buying shares today are paying a substantial premium to gain exposure to the streaming trend.On the other hand, a big tech or media company could buy ROKU as an efficient pathway to eyeballs. With Alphabet, Microsoft, and others lacking significant market share in the streaming space, buying them out would make them more formidable competitors to Amazon and Apple.At the current Roku stock price, the company is not a buy. Waiting until a material pullback is the smart move. In late 2018, shares tumbled from roughly $75 a share to below $30, before rallying back to over $100. In the event of another big decline, ROKU could be a solid opportunity.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not own a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1097,0.9919,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is amazing at turning mundane corporate management decisions into global news events.Many retailers host annual sale events. But Amazon “celebrates” Prime Day. Many chief executives write notes to their shareholders. But Jeff Bezos pens annual letters with “lessons” and “principle themes” and “important words” to behold. Many companies open satellite offices. Amazon “launched” HQ2 with a continent-wide pitch contest. And many companies train their employees. On Thursday, Amazon announced how much it’s spending on workplace training over the next six years: more than $700 million.Certainly, when a company has a market value near $1 trillion and a workforce of more than 600,000, each move is a bigger deal than a back-to-school sale at an independent bookstore. Yet, even among its technology industry peers, the e-commerce giant seems to have a magic touch, turning run-of-the-mill corporate events into big moments.As of last year, Google quietly amassed more than 7,000 employees in New York. But when Amazon said it was coming to town, the world was transfixed. And when it abandoned those plans, the governor scrambled. After all the fuss, Amazon ended up sending some workers to New York anyway.I told you almost two years ago about how Amazon was turning its earnings calls into marketing events and how it deftly used Whole Foods as an opportunity to highlight Amazon’s low, low prices. The company has marketing down pat. That’s not to say Amazon is all talk. The company did raise its minimum pay to $15 an hour last year. That’s real. And surely Amazon will work to retrain its U.S. employees.But let’s break down the numbers of this training program. Amazon said it’ll spend about $700 million on development for 100,000 employees by 2025. That’s $1,077 a person annually. According to one estimate from the Association for Talent Development, a trade group, the average organization spends $1,296 per employee annually on training. Well, you’ve got to admire Amazon’s commitment to undercutting the competition.Amazon is a humongous corporation. Training lots of people costs a great deal of money. In a world increasingly worried about monopolies, there’s a curious element to a company seeking praise just for being big.Bezos isn’t the first technology idol to entrance the world. Steve Jobs was famous for creating a so-called reality distortion field at Apple. Bill Gates recently described his old foe in mystical terms, saying “casting spells” was part of Jobs’s aura. “I would see people mesmerized,” Gates said. “But because I’m a minor wizard, the spells don’t work on me.”We should all aspire to be minor wizards when it comes to corporate pronouncements. Some claims, like ubiquitous drone delivery by 2018, will fail to materialize. Others are less impressive when you see how the magic trick is performed.This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter.

1100,0.9819,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is developing a higher quality version of the Echo speaker and ramping up work on its home robot.The company plans to release the new Echo by next year, according to people familiar with the product. Prototypes of the cylindrical speaker are wider than the current Echo to squeeze in additional components including at least four tweeters, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. The robot, previously reported by Bloomberg, has wheels and can be controlled by Alexa voice commands, the people said.Both devices are being developed by Amazon Lab126, a research and development arm based in Sunnyvale, California. The company’s hardware foray keeps customers wedded to its ecosystem -- buying products from Amazon.com and using services like Prime Video and Prime Music.The Echo, which went on sale in 2015, will grab 63% of the U.S. market this year, according to EMarketer. But it has lost some ground to the Sonos One, Apple Inc. HomePod and Google Home Max -- all of which claim to deliver superior audio. Google now has 31% of the market, while the rest have a combined 12%. The HomePod isn’t selling as well as Apple expected, and the company recently dropped the price.Amazon has previously attempted to improve the Echo’s sound with tweaks and offered a standalone subwoofer and device that links the speakers to a stereo. Amazon is also planning a high-fidelity version of its music service, according to Music Business Worldwide, that should mesh better with the new Echo. Amazon could still decide not to proceed with the new high-end Echo.The Seattle-based company typically rolls out a slew of devices in the fall, but sometimes scatters one-off product launches throughout the year. Amazon plans to start selling voice-controlled earbuds to rival Apple’s AirPods as early as this year, Bloomberg reported in April. The Echo range will also receive minor updates this fall, people familiar with the plans said.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Amazon originally intended to reveal the robot, known internally as “Vesta,” as early as this year, but the machine isn’t ready to be mass-produced, the people said. While Amazon could choose never to release the robot, in recent months it has pulled engineers from other projects to work on it -- a signal the company plans to sell Vesta at some point.It’s unclear what tasks the Amazon robot might perform. People familiar with the project speculated last year that the Vesta could be a sort of mobile Alexa, accompanying customers in parts of their home where they don’t have Echo devices.People familiar with the project describe prototypes that are about waist-high and navigate with the help of an array of computer-vision cameras. In an internal demonstration, an engineer summoned the machine with his voice.Amazon has said nothing publicly about Vesta, but a year ago, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos posted an Instagram photo of an Echo speaker taped to a Roomba vacuum cleaner. “What?!!!!” he wrote. “Found this in the living room when I got home. I have no idea.

1103,0.995,"(Bloomberg) -- When Josh Hawley, the freshman U.S. senator from Missouri, introduced a bill last month proposing a major change to one of the foundational laws of the modern internet, he was largely pilloried. Hawley’s idea — to make big tech companies convince the FTC they’re politically neutral if they want to continue receiving a crucial immunity from legal liability they’ve enjoyed for the last 20 years — was described as unserious and unworkable. Not a single lawmaker signed onto the bill as a co-sponsor. Hawley finally got a major endorsement on Thursday. President Donald Trump praised the bill at the White House’s social media summit – a gathering of rightwing figures who claim to be the victims of Silicon Valley’s liberal bias. The president then announced he was asking large social media companies – who were conspicuously absent from the first meeting – to come to the White House in the coming weeks and hash things out with Hawley, other unnamed legislators and administration officials.It was a major validation for Hawley, who has positioned himself as the right’s main Silicon Valley antagonist. While he has expressed concerns about the industry’s market power and privacy practices, Hawley has attracted the most attention when focusing on the main preoccupation of Republican tech critics: the supposed liberal bias of social media companies. “This has risen to the level of abortion, guns and taxes for grassroots Republicans,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist who has worked for Steve Bannon and the White House, and is now Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesman. “The White House holding this summit, and Hawley introducing the bill, those are just reflections of what the Republican base wants on this issue,” he said. “I think it was really meant to launch the first bullet in the next big tech wars.”  Hawley has effectively created a way to act on the free-form discontent with tech that Trump and others on the right have been articulating with mounting frequency. He’s done so by pulling a law known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act out of the confines of internet legal conferences and directly into the center of the online culture wars. Hawley has been signaling his intentions even before he took office. Two weeks after unseating Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill, Hawley posted a Twitter message hinting that Congress should punish the social network if it couldn’t prove it was pursuing “true diversity of political discourse.” The words were a coded reference to Section 230, which exempts internet platforms from political liability for content posted by their users. This immunity is widely credited with making it possible to run a site like Twitter or Facebook without being crushed by libel lawsuits.Dissatisfaction with Section 230 has been building for several years. Liberals charge that it has allowed tech companies to grow complacent about misinformation and harassment on their platforms. Conservatives often claim – incorrectly – that the immunity was meant to be predicated on political neutrality. The malcontents haven’t coalesced around a solution, in part because the available alternatives are all problematic. The blowback to Hawley’s bill over the last month illustrated this. Conservative groups like the American Enterprise Institute and Americans for Prosperity argued that Hawley’s plan would centralize power with unelected bureaucrats; Michigan’s Representative Justin Amash, an Independent, called it a “sweetheart deal for Big Government.” Those like Surabian that were more sympathetic to Hawley’s idea described it as an opening volley, something that its harshest critics dismissed out of hand. The bill has “no redeeming features; no interesting policy ideas to consider for future proposals; no meritorious conservation starters,” wrote Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University’s School of Law who has been one of Section 230’s most vocal supporters, in an essay this week. Tech companies seem unsure how to handle this moment. The backlash poses real peril, and the industry has increased its spending on lobbying in Washington, all while offering to adhere to new rules on issues like privacy. But there’s also a widespread feeling that Washington doesn’t understand tech – a conviction that deepens every time a lawmaker asks an embarrassingly uninformed question at a public hearing.   Michael Beckerman, executive director of the Internet Association, which represents all the primary targets of the social media summit, said critics like Hawley risk damaging the economy with policies based on a misunderstanding about how tech works.  “There’s a bit of confusion about the role of these platforms,” he said. “It’s not a public square. These are private companies, and it’s within their right to have community standards.”Hawley interprets criticism as evidence of Silicon Valley’s influence. “You see it every time I or somebody else makes a proposal — usually it’s me,” he said. “The Google chorus swings into action.” Following an interview, his staff quickly provided a list of right-leaning groups who have criticized his bill and received financial support from technology companies. Six months in Washington has proved to Hawley that the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, he said, is even worse than he thought. Hawley said he never wanted to be a politician, but he has a strange biography for a political outsider. A straight-laced graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, he’s a former law professor married to a current law professor; the two met when they were both clerking for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Hawley began poking at the tech industry in late 2017 as Missouri’s attorney general, when he opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet Inc.’s Google. It attracted nationwide media attention just as Hawley’s Senate run was ramping up, but dissipated before having any tangible impact. It’s a pattern that Hawley’s critics say foreshadowed his practices in the Senate. Hawley said he thought Silicon Valley was doing important work when he spoke with Bloomberg News in early 2018, but his views on tech have coarsened noticeably since then. In an essay in USA Today this May he questioned whether the country would be better off if Facebook disappeared entirely. In an interview over the fourth of July weekend, Hawley pointed to the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing as a reminder of how unimpressed he is about the current state of American technological innovation. &quot;What they’ve delivered are these more refined behavior ad platform businesses. They've not only failed to live up to expectations, but in many ways have been harmful to the country and the economy,” he said. Hawley doesn’t exactly say that what he wanted instead of Twitter was flying cars, but you get the point. While the bill addressing Section 230 has clear ideological undertones, Hawley has argued that concerns about the tech industry shouldn’t necessarily be partisan. He’s sponsored about a half-dozen bills related to tech, often in cooperation with Democrats, including proposals to create a “do not track” list for online data collection, stronger protections for children online, and restrictions on novel forms of video game-based gambling. When he isn’t introducing legislation or hammering the tech industry in public hearings, Hawley enjoys penning open letters. He's written to Facebook Inc. to question its commitment to privacy, to Apple Inc. to suggest it add a “do not track” option to its app store, and to Google, insinuating that shortcomings in its translation software stem from its attempts to cozy up to the Chinese government. Hawley’s work on privacy issues specifically have earned him a reputation among Democrats as the rare Republican willing to sign onto legislation pursuing what are seen as broadly held principles. Several people cited his age – at 39 he’s the Senate’s youngest member – as one of his qualifications to speak on tech issues. “It’s great to work with a Republican partner who is thinking deeply about these issues and, in this body especially, who has a young person’s fresh perspective,” said Virginia’s Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and Hawley’s co-sponsor on a bill imposing transparency requirements on companies that collect personal data.The prospects for any legislation aren’t great in 2019’s Washington. In such an atmosphere, legislative proposals often serve as a way to reframe the idea of what is possible. Hawley’s bill on Section 230 seems to be doing that. Lindsey Graham suggested at a hearing this week that restricting access to its protections could be used to pressure tech companies. Ted Cruz referred to the law as a subsidy for tech, and said he was interested in re-examining it. If nothing else, Hawley is playing a note that is increasingly resonant in Republican politics. Industry groups and many academics view these developments with alarm. On Thursday, a group of 50 internet law experts published a list of principles for lawmakers considering modifying Section 230, an implicit acknowledgement that this is a growing possibility. Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who recently wrote a book about Section 230, said tech companies have seen the law’s protections as justification to ignore legitimate complaints. “Congress, with one vote and a signature from the president, could get rid of all of Section 230,” said Kosseff, who believes it was inevitable that someone like Hawley was going to come along. “That’s what I’ve been trying to beat into their heads. ‘Guys, you have to take this seriously.’” To contact the author of this story: Joshua Brustein in New York at jbrustein@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Emily Biuso at ebiuso@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.05,0.872,0.078,1
1104,0.9914,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. looks like it may put down close to $1 billion just to keep its devices at the leading edge. Japan Display Inc., one of its key providers of screens, said Friday morning it would get up to $400 million from bailout partner Harvest Tech Investment Management Co. Nestled into its two-page stock exchange statement was the revelation that the funding includes $100 million already pledged by a customer.That customer is Apple, according to a Bloomberg News story published in late June. Taiwan’s TPK Holding Co., another long-time iPhone component supplier, had been in talks to join a $1.1 billion rescue package for Japan Display but pulled out. That left the company needing to look elsewhere, and Apple stepped in to help fill the void.This development comes a week after Apple’s main screen supplier, Samsung Electronics Co., made a cryptic reference to a “one-time gain related to the display business” in its preliminary second-quarter earnings statement. The U.S. company will pay as much as 1 trillion won ($850 million) to make up for a shortfall in purchases of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, according to South Korea’s Electronics Times and analysts at Citigroup Global Markets. (Apple hadn’t replied to a request for comment by publication time Friday.)What’s interesting about both these cases is that neither of the payments appears to be for purchasing components directly. Rather, they are simply to prop up or compensate suppliers that Apple uses to manufacture the most advanced screens available. Samsung is among companies that preceded Apple in incorporating OLED displays in smartphones, yet the iPhone maker is the only one that buys them by the tens of millions. It relies on Samsung’s display division to make that happen. Apple probably locked in that supply by promising to buy a minimum amount, and it may have fallen short given recent weakness in iPhone growth. At the same time, the U.S. company desperately needs alternative sources to ensure it’s not beholden to any one supplier. That’s where a Japan Display bailout comes in. The Japanese company said its 20.4 billion yen ($188 million) operating loss in the March quarter was wider than the prior period “as a result of R&D expenses for preparation of OLED mass production.”Japan Display being able to make lots of OLED screens is great news for Apple – as long as it doesn’t go belly-up before that happens. Apple, therefore, has an incentive to keep the company afloat.With global smartphone brands running out of novel ways to spice up their offerings, it’s crucial for premium devices such as the iPhone to maintain technological leadership. In a downturn, Apple’s starting to find out the price of staying at the bleeding edge. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1110,0.9982,"(Bloomberg) -- In a packed ballroom in Beijing’s national convention center, the executive from a major technology company laid out ambitious plans for the future of artificial intelligence in China. He explained how customized semiconductors would help power everything from autonomous cars to voice-activated industrial machines.Only this wasn’t a state-backed enterprise. This was Intel Corp., the largest U.S. chipmaker.The company’s AI chief, Naveen Rao, pledged to work closely, “engineer to engineer,&quot; on cutting-edge technology with the 7,000 people that attended Baidu Inc.’s annual developers conference last week. Intel was the top sponsor of the event.Rao made no mention of politics, though his overwhelming support of Baidu, a Chinese national tech champion, sent a powerful message: Even as U.S. and Chinese leaders are locked in a fierce battle over technological supremacy, companies like Intel remain big backers of China’s tech industry because they rely on the country for significant contributions of revenue, production chains and even talent.Intel made 27% of its revenue in China last year, more than in the U.S. or any other market, but it’s fighting to hold on to customers there that it spent decades cultivating. Like many American multinationals with large businesses in the country, Intel is walking a fine line between holding on to that lucrative market and keeping in Washington’s good graces. Neutrality is becoming a tougher stance to maintain.&quot;There’s been a psychotic break” in what some leaders in the U.S. government want and what American businesses want, said Josh Dorfman, founder of One Thousand Million, a China-focused consultancy and think tank based in Dallas. &quot;Unlike in China, U.S. companies aren’t beholden to the country and are not obligated in any way, shape, or form to be patriotic. They want to make money.&quot;An Intel spokesman said the company remains engaged with Chinese customers that aren’t on the U.S.’s list of those it sees as a security threat. China is a substantial market for Intel and it has no intention of pulling out now.Intel isn’t alone. Apple Inc. is heavily dependent on China not only for the manufacture of Mac computers and iPhones but it’s also a major consumer market, accounting for about 20% of sales. Even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs that would hit Apple products, the California-based company was making plans to shift production of its new Mac Pro computer to China, sending a clear signal of support.While some companies are considering moving part of their production out of the country, many others are making gestures of goodwill. Walmart Inc. last week pledged to invest $1.2 billion in China to upgrade logistics distribution centers. Boeing Co. is in negotiations to sell 100 jetliners to Chinese airlines in one of its largest-ever deals, Bloomberg News reported. And last month, 600 U.S. companies and trade groups signed a letter to Trump warning of tariff-related hits to their businesses.IBM’s Greater China group chairman Liming Chen said that the escalation of China-U.S. trade frictions has created a &quot;confusing environment&quot; for businesses. He outlined International Business Machine Corp.’s long relationship with China, dating back to its products first entering the country in the 1920s, and formally establishing a Shanghai office in 1936.&quot;IBM has participated in the rapid development of China over the past 40 years, while China has also nourished IBM,&quot; he wrote in a post on WeChat in June, calling the country an &quot;indispensable part of our global strategy map.&quot;The U.S.-China trade war is anchored in competition to dominate the next generation of wireless networks and other technologies as much as politics. The Trump administration worries that American companies in search of profits could actually help China’s tech industry eclipse U.S. prowess in sensitive areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning.The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, lambasted Alphabet Inc. in March for Google’s AI work in China, which he alleged &quot;indirectly benefits the Chinese military.&quot; Trump repeated the critique in a subsequent tweet, questioning the Google parent’s loyalties. Google has said it doesn’t work with China’s military.The same nationalistic fervor is partly behind the Commerce Department’s May prohibition on selling American components to Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies Co. Despite Trump’s recent pledge to ease restrictions, Huawei remains on America’s so-called entities list and U.S. firms must apply for special licenses to sell parts to the company.That hasn’t stopped chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. from feverishly trying to find ways to keep supplying the company, one of its largest customers. The U.S. semiconductor industry also lobbied the Trump administration to loosen restrictions on Huawei.Still, American tech companies are facing a new global reality. They may no longer be able to overlook geopolitics in favor of profits. China may not be the growth savior it once was.Tech companies &quot;must now live in a world where their Chinese business partners and global value chains at any given day could blow up,&quot; said James Lewis, director of the tech and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank. “Trump might have backed off Huawei for now but next week it could be something different and any of these companies are fair game.”Lewis, who previously served as the U.S. Commerce Department’s lead for national security and espionage concerns related to high-technology trade with China, said Chinese firms are also racing to become less reliant on the very American firms bending over backwards to keep their business.Splitting the two economies won’t be easy. Research, development, manufacturing and talent in the U.S. and China are still very much interconnected.&quot;Innovation by American companies is fueled by access to the Chinese market,&quot; said Samm Sacks, cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at think tank New America, in Congressional testimony in May.For Intel’s AI chief, collaboration with China helps the company to build better products and bring new technology to market fast.“I’m proud of the strong and growing partnership between Intel and Baidu,” Intel’s Rao said in Beijing, after greeting developers with a hearty “nihao.” “By working together to advance AI, Baidu and Intel are helping to usher in a world where AI is ubiquitous.”&#92;--With assistance from Gao Yuan.To contact the reporters on this story: Shelly Banjo in Hong Kong at sbanjo@bloomberg.net;Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.038,0.838,0.124,1

1123,0.9957,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’d summon social media companies for a meeting at the White House to discuss conservative grievances about alleged political bias on their platforms, and that he had directed his administration to explore methods to protect online speech.“We will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month,” Trump told his audience at an event Thursday the White House billed as a “social media summit.”“Have a big meeting and a real conversation,” Trump said. He also said he would direct the administration to “explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.”“We’re fighting for you very hard,” the president said earlier, after he and other speakers at the event complained of suffering censorship by social media companies. “We’re going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for -- in a week or two. They have to be here.”While Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. and other internet platforms weren’t invited to Thursday’s event, several presidential fans, provocateurs, leaders of conservative groups, media figures, and lawmakers said they were going -- including some who’ve faced allegations of racism and antisemitism, trolling and conspiracy theories.“Some of you are extraordinary,” Trump told the audience. “Can’t say everybody. The crap you think of is unbelievable.”Later, he added: “Some of you guys are out there. I mean it’s genius, but it’s bad.”Representatives of Google, Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the potential White House meeting.Bias ClaimsThe president said the “journalists” and “influencers” who attended the event are “fulfilling a vital role in our nation” by communicating “directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake news filter.” Trump has often said his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, where he frequently announces official news, is vital for him to communicate directly with the American public.Despite claims that they face systematic bias by companies hosting social media platforms, Trump enjoys an audience of about 62 million followers at his personal Twitter account and more than 24 million at his official Facebook page. He said he and his summit audience reach a combined “half a billion followers.”“I know that we’ve been blocked,” Trump said, relating anecdotes about people telling him they were unable to follow his Twitter account.The event was billed as a way to “bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment,” according to a statement announcing the meeting. But the confirmed attendees were primarily conservative tech critics who echo Trump’s own complaints that social media systematically silences conservative voices.Trump said that when the conference concludes, he’ll speak on the 2020 U.S. Census. Trump will retreat from his effort to include a citizenship question in the decennial census after a defeat at the U.S. Supreme Court, and will seek the information through other means, an administration official said.The president has repeatedly accused large technology platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google of anti-conservative bias, with little evidence. Last month, he said the U.S. government should sue Facebook and Google for unspecified wrongdoing.In May, the administration posted a form urging people to report potential political censorship by the social media companies, which White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Wednesday got “thousands of responses.” The form is now defunct.“I don’t think there’s going to be serious policy matters discussed,” said Ethan Porter, a professor at George Washington University who has studied the political role of media in the Trump era. “It looks like a theatrical gathering at the White House -- a venting session for conservative media stars.”Senator Josh Hawley also spoke at the event. The Missouri Republican is pushing legislation that would require social media companies to certify they don’t engage in censorship based on politics or face revocation of liability protections for content their users post. Trump called his proposal “important.”QAnon, O’KeefeThe summit attracted figures like Bill Mitchell, a Twitter booster of Trump’s who has promoted the conspiracy theory known as QAnon; as well as the person behind a pro-Trump meme account known as @CarpeDonktum, whose work has attracted retweets from the president.Brent Bozell, who heads an organization devoted to exposing alleged liberal media bias and once compared President Barack Obama to “a skinny, ghetto crackhead,” was also expected, alongside another Twitter personality who has said the media was pushing a civil war.The conservative nonprofit Project Veritas, which uses undercover sting operations in attempts to expose wrongdoing, said founder James O’Keefe would be there. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and frequent Google critic, is scheduled to attend, as is Republican Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.Traditional Washington conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation will be represented. So will a fairly new one, the youth-focused group Turning Point USA, which has been accused of promoting baseless claims against liberals.The White House schedule initially listed the event as closed to the press, but a revised version said Trump’s remarks will be open to reporters. “The Fake News Media will also be there, but for a limited period,” Trump tweeted.Ben Garrison, a pro-Trump political cartoonist, tweeted Wednesday that his invitation had been rescinded after criticism that one of his works, which depicted Jewish financiers controlling U.S. foreign policy, was anti-Semitic. Garrison denied the accusation.Election ConnectionAccusing social media companies of shutting out conservative agendas could help Trump maintain ties to allies, some of whom have devoted media followings of their own, Porter said. Trump officially launched his re-election campaign last month, and it reported last week that he and the Republican National Committee had together raised $105 million in the second quarter and had $100 million in available cash.Nearly 65% of Republicans or those who lean Republican believe big tech companies support liberal views over conservative ones, and a full 85% think it’s at least somewhat likely the companies are intentionally censoring viewpoints, according to a Pew Research Center survey from last year.“There is a segment of the population that’s motivated to get out to vote based on what they’re against,” said Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for Republican Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign who has also worked with technology companies.Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents large technology companies, said in a statement that his members provide “the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history,” including conservatives.“Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,” Beckerman said.Pressure on the technology companies is increasing in Washington as Republicans in Congress dig into allegations of conservative bias, Democrats in the House conduct an antitrust inquiry and enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission divvy up oversight of Google, Facebook, Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. Politicians from both parties are also exploring limiting liability protections that the companies enjoy for third-party content.Jesse Blumenthal, who directs tech policy for the network of groups funded by the libertarian Koch brothers, said that those on the right have long feared gatekeepers would keep conservative opinions from out of the public square.“That is not a new complaint,” said Blumenthal, who advocates for the government to stay out of speech issues. “What is new is, so what do you want the government to do about it?”The fight to remove the government from regulating speech resulted in the successful push to end the “fairness doctrine” that required television broadcasters give equal amounts of time to candidates seeking public office, Blumenthal said. Trump has mused about bringing the idea back for social media.&#92;--With assistance from Alyza Sebenius and Margaret Talev.To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Justin BlumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.055,0.851,0.094,1
1124,0.9655,"It was shaky action in the Nasdaq today. At first, the index rallied to new all-time highs, hitting 8,226. Then, it fell and closed lower by 0.08%. The rally came on more hints from Fed Chair Powell suggesting a rate cut is coming later this month.Source: Shutterstock The market is now fully pricing in at least a 25 basis point cut to the Fed funds rate. If the rate doesn't materialize, the stock market will surely sell off as a result. I'd expect tech to get hit extra hard under that circumstance. As it stands, markets are pricing in a 20% chance of a 50 basis point cut, which is up notably over the past few days.Worth pointing out is that a majority of the market is preparing for that 50 basis point cut at the September meeting, with odds standing at about 56%. Further, there is a roughly 12% chance of a 75 basis point cut by then.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs fun as it is to talk about the Fed almost daily… it is the commanding topic on Wall Street at the moment.  * 3 Forgotten Tech Stocks Worth Remembering However, earnings are set to pick up in the second half of the month, setting the stage for some big moves in tech and elsewhere. You know investors in the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) are bracing for some action with FAANG set to report in a few weeks. Heard at the Nasdaq TodayMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hit new all-time highs again, and drew in a new analyst in the process. Cowen initiated coverage of MSFT with an outperform rating and $150 price target. They argue that MSFT has positioned itself in the right secular growth markets, although the coverage is certain to draw some criticism of Cowen's timing. I mean, up 35% so far in 2019 and this is when they start coverage?In any regard, the target implies about 8.5% upside from current levels.Bank of America analysts sent Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock to new 52-week highs after they upped their price target from $12 to $17. They make the case that downloads of Snapchat are up more than 60% sequentially and year over year. If true, it could lead to better-than-expected user growth.Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) took a hit on the chin in early Thursday trading, but closed lower by &quot;just&quot; 0.54% after a downgrade to hold at Jefferies. The firm's $115 price target is just below TTWO's current price of $116.53. News on the Nasdaq TodayAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music has reportedly seen its subscriber base rise 70% over the past year.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music has also boasted strong growth with its service earlier this year, helping to drive its robust $10-billion-per-quarter Services unit higher. The rise in music subscribers for Amazon comes as little surprise, as consumers continue to gravitate toward Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Apple Music, Amazon Music and other streaming services.Biotech stocks took it on the chin Thursday. A likely decision from the White House is benefiting some groups in healthcare and hurting others. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Humana (NYSE:HUM), Cigna (NYSE:CI) and others benefited from the news -- here's how to trade Cigna's big rally -- while others suffered.Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and others all took a hefty hit on high volume. Of the names above, BMY and REGN hit new 52-week lows in the session.The question now becomes, will it be a one-day beating or is this just the start?Last but certainly not least, Apple is reportedly gearing up to offer its higher-end iPhones in India. The idea of Apple tapping into a market with 1 billion consumers is certainly appealing to investors. That's even as affordability in a country like India vs. the U.S. are quite different.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown According to the report, the XR and the XS could hit regional markets throughout the country. Further, Apple plans to assemble the units in India. This keeps the company from having to pay high taxes on the import of these devices.

1138,-0.9849,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock  is showing small signs of progress. NVDA stock has been a falling knife over the past six months. But now, the stock, while not recovering tremendously, has at least stopped going down for the time being. Is Nvidia stock's  seemingly endless plunge finally over?Source: Shutterstock The answer likely comes down to the following question: Will NVDA stock catch up to the stock market, or continue to trade on its own merit? The stock market is obviously booming, with the major averages making new all-time highs. Tech stocks in particular have been on fire. Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has been going up a little with the market, but then slipping back quickly. For example, last week, NVDA hit $166, but then slipped back to $160, even as the market continued to surge.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown That's because NVDA faces a ton of company-specific and sector-specific problems. These range from excessive inventory to the product issues facing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and the trade war.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Semiconductor Industry Is Caught in the CrossfireThe trade war is dragging on and on. That's awful news for leading semiconductor companies such as NVDA. According to Nvidia's most recent annual report, fully 74% of the company's revenues came from Asia during its last full fiscal year. The company generated $3.4 billion of revenue from Taiwan alone last year. It got $2.8 billion from mainland China and Hong Kong, and another $2.4 billion from the rest of Asia.NVDA got just $1.5 billion of revenue from the U.S.,  equaling barely 10% of its overall revenues. Amazingly, the small island of Taiwan buys more than twice as much from Nvidia  as all of the United States does. Needless to say, the longer the trade war goes on, the more NVDA stock  and its peers  will suffer negative  consequences.There's been some upbeat chatter about a potential resolution to the U.S.-China trade issues. Reportedly Trump and the Chinese delegation did a lot of talking ahead of the recent G-20 meeting. And there was an agreement of sorts related to Huawei, but it appears to be more of a temporary ceasefire than a solution. Until we get something concrete, Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor industry will likely struggle. Rivals Feeling the HeatGlobal electronics giant Samsung exemplified the trade war issues with its earnings pre-release last Thursday. Samsung makes both semiconductor chips, competing with the likes of Micron (NASDAQ:MU) in memory. while also making plenty of end products such as phones and TVs.In any case, Samsung announced that it sees its operating profits for this quarter falling by more than 50%. Samsung blamed the decline on a combination of the trade war, weak memory prices, and soft demand from other customers. Reportedly, for example, the demand for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone was so sluggish that Apple will have to pay Samsung some sort of compensation for not meeting minimum order levels.When giants like Apple and Samsung are failing to meet investors' expectations, it's clear that there's a  broad slowdown in consumer electronics. As great as Nvidia's technology is, NVDA can't prosper in a world in which the whole consumer electronics sector is in a slump. If Apple, Samsung etc. continue to struggle, NVDA stock isn't going anywhere, either. Why Nvidia Stock Price Can ReboundNvidia hasn't  given a whole lot of details about its outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with its last quarterly earnings report, NVDA stopped providing full-year guidance. That's often a sign of trouble ahead. That said, if you're looking for a bullish case on Nvidia stock, you can patch one together.For one thing, its inventory levels have declined in some areas, particularly in graphics. It appears the overbuilding of graphics cards has ended. And while bitcoin's surge won't set off another mining boom like it did in 2017, it will probably help increase demand to a certain extent. People still use GPUs to mine cryptocurrency after all.Overall, Nvidia's revenues will probably start to flatten out by the end of the year. If nothing else, at least the jarring double-digit-percentage revenue declines across all of its business segments will come to an end. If and when the trade war ends, Nvidia should finally be able to get back to revenue growth. As is often the case for tech companies, once NVDA's revenue bottoms, Nvidia stock price should start shooting back up again. The Verdict on NVDA StockIf Nvidia stock price was trading at fire-sale levels, there'd be a case for buying NVDA at this point. The company has fantastic technology and will surely bounce back sooner or later.But Nvidia stock is still aggressively valued after its seemingly huge decline. Nvidia is now selling at 31 times its trailing earnings. If you believe analysts' average estimates, its earnings will shoot up to $7 per share over the next year, pushing the P/E ratio to a more reasonable - though hardly cheap -  23&#92;. With its revenues still declining, however, it's hard to see how this earnings explosion is going to occur.Ultimately the trade war will get sorted out, and Nvidia will get its momentum back. But there's no reason that such a development will necessarily happen in 2019. Nvidia stock price is far from cheap at this valuation. It may go up  a little if the stock market keeps roaring higher. But until Nvisia's business gets its momentum back, the stock will continue to underperform the market as a whole.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned INTC stock.

1163,0.986,"Among investment categories, the semiconductor group finds itself in an awkward situation. And within this sub-segment, traders are attempting to decipher Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). On one hand, MU stock has performed well following the truce in U.S.-China trade war tensions. On the other hand, the company faces fundamental challenges that could hurt its equity value.Source: Shutterstock Of course, the biggest hurdle impacting Micron stock is the computer chip market; specifically, pricing for flash-memory NAND chips and so-called &quot;volatile&quot; DRAM chips. Currently, the semiconductor market is experiencing a lull. For instance, DRAM chips - which largely service PCs and data servers - plummeted nearly 30% in the first quarter of 2019.Obviously, that does no good for the MU stock price. After all, Micron specializes in producing both NAND and DRAM chips.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven worse, many experienced analysts in the semiconductor space believe that the DRAM market is still vulnerable to further corrections. That puts investments like Micron stock, as well as broader competitors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on notice.Here's the problem: NAND is a type of memory that is particularly useful for smartphones and mobile devices. But a time when even Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) once-dominant iPhone is experiencing lagging sales, NAND presents less of an opportunity. Thus, semiconductor firms' hopes rested on DRAM, and for good reason.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Based on DRAM's unique architecture -- a densely structured chip that allows for billions of memory cells crammed into a small space -- it's best suited for data servers. Due to the burgeoning data center evolution, Micron can feed this growing demand. That benefits MU stock, provided that demand sustains itself.Evidence suggests that it's not, drawing questions for Micron stock. Complicated Narrative Surrounds MU StockBefore we dive in, you should know this: semiconductor firms ebb and flow with the underlying chip market. And whether for better or for worse, the chip market is incredibly volatile. Moreover, research firm Gartner (NYSE:IT) predicted two years ago that 2019 would be a downturn for DRAM.So far, that prediction has proven prescient. Naturally, it presents a worrying case for MU stock.Now, some investors have a tendency to ignore such high-level analysis as not being in touch with the ground floor. However, if you're thinking about buying Micron stock, you should at least understand the risk: historically, MU's pricing is intricately linked to the memory-chip market.  Click to EnlargeFor instance, from January 2017 through the end of January 2018, DRAM's price-per-gigabit increased from 66 cents to 97 cents. Along the way, the pricing experienced some twists and turns.Over the same period, the MU stock price increased from $24.11 to $43.72. Like the underlying DRAM market, Micron did not have a straight shot skyward. Shares moved almost in lock-step with DRAM prices, with a correlation coefficient of 84%.I note a similar trend comparing Micron stock with total DRAM and NAND global revenues. As chip sales increase, so too does MU shares. Unsurprisingly, when chip sales stall, shareholders are taken on an unpleasant ride.  Click to EnlargeAdmittedly, I'm charting the obvious. However, this data also confirms that MU stock rarely moves against the grain. So if DRAM is about to tumble deeper, it might be time to hit the exits.But that's only true if the forecasts of doom are valid. From the numbers I'm seeing, data centers have strong tailwinds. For instance, demand for cooling equipment necessary to keep data-server chipboards at optimal temperatures is increasing. That doesn't make sense unless data centers are likewise rising. Long-Term Picture Remains Bullish for Micron StockLogically, if the tides shift positively for DRAM, MU stock stands to profit handsomely. Especially at these undervalued prices, contrarians may want to consider picking up some shares.That said, it's always difficult predicting nearer-term swings. Sentiment could turn negative on absolutely silly reasons. And that could end up making me look silly as well.But where I'm more confident is the longer-term picture. In this context, I think President Donald Trump's trade war with China is the perfect tailwind, and not a dark cloud. I say this because for years, perhaps decades, American tech firms have not operated on level ground with the Chinese.Generally, Americans played by the rules. The Chinese have not. This strange, uncontested dynamic allowed the Asian juggernaut to harmfully troll the tech space.But the Trump administration is putting a hard-stop on China's shady business practices. And while the trade war hurts now, it's incredibly beneficial for our semiconductor industry's long-term, sustained growth. Bring in the DRAM factor and you have a case here for a deeply profitable discount in Micron stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

After leading the market the beginning of the year, then selling off, they look poised for another run to new 52-week highs.Given that the U.S.-China trade war is still not fully resolved and ramifications of a stronger dollar are still rippling through global markets, the run into new highs could be in the short or medium term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: The Race for 1 Intensifies There are also the domestic regulatory uncertainties that make timing difficult, so if investors are looking to go the options route, longer dated ones into the fall may provide some protection options.That's just another reason to like Google best among the FANGs. In particular, mobile hardware and software is an area worth focusing on. GOOGL Stock Gets a Boost from Mobile Google stock has many tailwinds, not least of which is capitalizing on the continued growth of mobile.Mobile truly is eating the world. And looking at reviews of GOOGL's latest smartphone, a space which has historically been dominated by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  it would seem that GOOGL has a better shot than ever before at dethroning the company founded by Steve Jobs.For a long time, Android was seen a clunkier, cheaper alternative to elegant iOS and accompanying hardware that was shaped in large part by John Ives, who has recently announced his departure.Nowadays though, judging by the reviews of the newest Pixel 3a and 3XL, both from a hardware and operating system standpoint, Apple needs to watch its back.The Chinese consumer is being corralled to buy domestic amidst trade war posturing, so the China growth story isn't necessarily going to be the untapped market that Apple was hoping for. In addition to that, GOOGL really has created a product that can go toe-to-toe with the golden child of mobile hardware. Users Are Raving About PixelThe Pixel 3 was highlighted as the &quot;best android phone of 2018.&quot; It has continued to create mobile products that appeal to a large audience in terms of functionality, form, and affordability.The 3a and 3XL are phones that are targeted toward a more mainstream user base and based on trial usage by the author, are worthy competitors to other smartphones on the market.Reviewers indicated that even well into 2019, the Google Pixel 3 &quot;has the best smartphone camera you can buy.&quot; As for the new Pixel 3a, the reviews are even more resoundingly positive. &quot;The Google Pixel 3a doesn't feel like the affordable cousin of a high-end phone - it feels more like a powerful and impressive mid-range handset in its own right, with great specs and useful features inherited from the Pixel 3 that you won't find in many other similarly-priced devices.&quot; Market Share Gains and Google StockIt's no surprise then that Alphabet has been taking share from Apple. Market share woes for Apple mean market share gains for GOOGL stock.Recent data comparing Android to iOS from Q1 2019 to Q1 2018 show overall losses for iOS and overall gains for GOOGL.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth in the Second Half of 2019 In Canada, iOS lost over 10% share. It also lost over 12% in Egypt, 14% in Ireland, 9% in Italy and Japan, and a concerning 18.17% in Portugal. There were some gains, though, such as 11.65% in Malaysia, where Android had enjoyed almost 90% market share in 2018.Android benefits from these iOS declines and has seen substantial increases across those same countries in addition to Brazil, Canada, India, and South Africa.Alphabet has managed to close the gap in the UK to just 2.3 percent share difference and in Canada to just 0.43 percent. The Bottom Line on Google StockRemember that Android is a tactical strategy for GOOGL. The open source approach has its share of detractors, but it this is the long game.Shareholders will ultimately benefit from this strategy here as and increasing number of mobile and tablet users are exposed to Alphabet's vast ecosystem of services and apps.This means more app sales and a better advertising proposition for ad buyers, which is the heart of Google's business model.With each passing month, the Google stock value proposition and potential outperformance increases.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1180,0.8538,"Without question, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the best performers so far this year. Since January's opening price, QCOM stock has skyrocketed 39%. And just as well, Qualcomm's rise in the markets reflects broader positive sentiment toward semiconductors. For instance, the sector-related exchange-traded fund iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up 30% year-to-date.But despite this good news, potential troubles are looming over the horizon. Last week and just before the Independence Day holiday, a federal judge ruled against Qualcomm in a paradigm-altering antitrust case. The semiconductor giant immediately appealed, but the process may take a more than a year to complete. Since the unfavorable ruling, Qualcomm stock has remained range bound.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsComplicating matters for QCOM is both rival and client Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). For the consumer tech giant, many view these legal proceedings as a comeuppance. And under ordinary circumstances, Apple may have a case. Certainly, the Federal Trade Commission agrees with them. But in the time of Trump and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, nothing is ordinary. Thus, it's difficult to make pronouncements on QCOM stock.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Why the difficulty? Primarily, antitrust concerns have expanded from being merely business matters into geopolitical ones. That is, penalizing QCOM for anticompetitive actions may benefit free markets, but at the expense of U.S. technological dominance. Not bringing this context into the mix ignores a critical component in assessing Qualcomm stock. Apple Has a Point about QCOM StockBefore we dive in, we should understand how QCOM stock got embroiled in a massive legal battle. For a detailed analysis, I highly recommend InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin's longform breakdown. To summarize, Qualcomm has an extensive history of running afoul of international antitrust laws.By default, this shores up Apple's case because the facts demonstrate this isn't Qualcomm's first rodeo. Subsequently, Qualcomm stock looks shaky. To Martin's point, it's an element that prospective buyers shouldn't ignore.At the heart of Qualcomm versus Apple debate is the former's patent and licensing businesses. As a premium semiconductor provider, consumer tech firms like smartphone manufacturers highly value Qualcomm's critical chipsets. With the introduction of the 5G network, QCOM has even greater power due to its leadership in this next-generation market.Naturally, Qualcomm runs a very lucrative business licensing its core technologies. This revenue stream underlined the huge growth in QCOM stock over the years. However, Apple contends that Qualcomm is not playing fair with its double dipping.What exactly does that mean? In short, Apple claims that Qualcomm charges royalties on innovations that have nothing to do with the semiconductor firm. Essentially, QCOM is benefiting from two revenue streams from the same source: one for the initial license, and a second for royalties based on a company's own innovations using the original licensed technology. It's a nifty arrangement for Qualcomm stock.Moreover, the chipmaker gets away with it because if its clients won't play ball, Qualcomm won't provide the chips. If QCOM was a discount-bin organization, no one would care. But they own the best 5G technologies; therefore, this practice amounts to a monopoly.And if that monopoly goes away, QCOM stock is in big trouble. China Might &quot;Rescue&quot; Qualcomm StockBut before you hit the sell button on QCOM stock, you should know that the Qualcomm narrative has two components: one between Qualcomm and Apple, and the other between the U.S. and China.As a capitalistic organization, I expect Apple to raise hell: that's what they should do for their organization, their employees, and their shareholders. If I held stake in the company, I'd be disappointed if they didn't.But you must understand - as I alluded earlier - that antitrust accusations have absorbed geopolitical overtones. While I understand the FTC's point, and even the federal judge who ruled against Qualcomm, they're merely job-doers. What I mean is that they're assessing Qualcomm from the perspective of antitrust violations.Is QCOM guilty here? I'm not a legal expert, but they might be. However, that's not what truly hurts Qualcomm stock.Instead, Qualcomm is vital to our national security and our interests moving forward. As The Wall Street Journal's John D. McKinnon pointed out, Qualcomm has used the national security argument before. And it's no small matter. When the FTC first challenged the company's patent-royalty business, representatives from the defense and energy departments sat down with the regulatory agency.Obviously, the meetings didn't convince the FTC to drop its case against Qualcomm. However, the fact that the Department of Defense took an interest in this case tells you something.And that something is that China is lurking in the corner. More critically, they have no qualms about playing dirty to advance their nationalistic agenda. In addition, China's flagship companies like Huawei or Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) received unquestioned support from their government.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Here in the U.S.? We're about to prosecute one of our best and brightest. This terrible optic just might convince legal authorities to reverse course. Do the Ends Justify the Means?Without exaggeration or hyperbole, when you're dealing with QCOM stock, you're facing a philosophical question: do the ends justify the means?I may attract some heat for this opinion, but I think they do. Frankly, I don't understand what the point of upholding moral principles when our adversaries routinely break them. Due to this high-level trolling, at some point, China will beat us.And not only that, the FTC and other regulatory agencies are playing into China's hands. Again, China doesn't prosecute its companies for international trade and commerce infractions; the country encourages it!On a similar note, this is the reason why I think efforts to stymie big tech firms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is naive. What most people I'd argue fail to realize is that we're in the middle of a tech cold war. While Apple has some grievances, let me be blunt: I'd rather America win this critical war and let Apple lose its battle with Qualcomm than the other way around.But will the ultimate arbiters see it this way? I just don't know. But I think the case is strong enough - again, please reference the DOD meeting with the FTC -- that investors shouldn't panic on QCOM stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1182,0.8491,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. France won’t back off from its planned tax on companies like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google even after the U.S. suggested it may use trade tools against the levy.The French Senate passed a bill on Thursday to impose a 3% tax on global tech companies with at least 750 million euros ($845 million) in worldwide revenue and digital sales totaling 25 million euros in France. The U.S. said Wednesday that it will examine whether the tax would hurt its tech firms, using the so-called 301 investigation, the same tool President Donald Trump deployed to impose tariffs on Chinese goods because of the country’s alleged theft of intellectual property.France said the digital tax is in keeping with international rules, and that it won’t accept the use of trade tools to try to thwart it.“I deeply believe that between allies we can and must resolve our differences in ways other than with threats,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a speech in the Senate. “France is a sovereign state that decides its tax measures with sovereignty and will continue to take sovereign tax decisions.”With the passage of the bill, France will become the first country in the European Union to impose such a levy, with other nations, including the U.K. and Germany, mulling similar taxes. A broad, EU-wide digital tax failed to garner a consensus in the 28-nation bloc this year, with France among the biggest advocates of a region-wide tax on tech companies’ revenue from digital advertising, user data sales and the like -- the so-called GAFA tax (after Google, Apple Inc., Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.).The British government is proposing a 2% tax on “the revenues of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces which derive value from U.K. users” to come in to force from April 2020, according to its draft finance bill published Thursday.Related Story: Threat of Legal Challenges Hangs Over French Digital TaxFirst InvestigationThe French law, which goes into effect retroactively as Jan. 1, 2019, targets about 30 companies around the world. While most of them would be American, the list would also include Chinese, German, U.K. and even French firms. It would affect companies that profit from providing digital services to French users.President Emmanuel Macron has two weeks to sign off or seek changes to the law. French presidents rarely modify laws once they are passed by parliament. It has only happened three times in the last 40 years.Le Maire said he spoke to U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin Wednesday, and noted that it’s the first time in the history of relations between the two countries that Washington has opened a 301 investigation against France.Trade TensionsThe passage of the tax bill and the U.S. investigation threaten to further strain trans-Atlantic ties as the two sides prepare to negotiate a limited trade agreement on industrial goods. The French government has in the past asked the U.S. to work with Europe at the OECD for a “fair digital tax.”Those OECD talks have accelerated in recent months. Le Maire reiterated that France would abolish its revenue tax if an OECD accord is reached. In May, the minister said he was optimistic for an agreement this year.“My message to our American partners is that (the tax) should encourage them to accelerate even more the work on an international digital tax solution at the OECD level,” Le Maire said Thursday.Meanwhile, the U.S. said its Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have as long as a year to examine whether the French tax plan will hurt U.S. technology firms, and suggest remedies.The U.S. is concerned that the tax “unfairly targets American companies,” Lighthizer said in a statement announcing the action on Wednesday. “The president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.”The U.S. can levy tariffs specifically on products from France even though it is a member of the EU, said Douglas Heffner, a international trade litigator at law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath. Under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the president has authority to impose tariffs or take other restrictive measures if it’s determined that a foreign country’s trading rules are damaging to U.S. businesses.G7 Meeting“The U.S. can be very creative,” Heffner said. “They don’t have to just go after digital products. They can go after products where they have leverage.”The move would come as talks on a limited trans-Atlantic trade agreement on industrial goods have progressed slowly because the U.S. and EU are at odds over whether to include agriculture in any final agreement. France is the country most adamantly opposed to making any agriculture concessions. Trump’s threat to impose a tariff of as much as 25% on European car exports has cast a cloud over the negotiations as well.Finance ministers and central bankers at a Group of Seven meeting in Chantilly, France, next week will discuss international taxation and competition and the digital economy.(Updates with OECD accord details in 10th and 11th paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Jenny Leonard and Laura Davison.To contact the reporters on this story: William Horobin in Paris at whorobin@bloomberg.net;Helene Fouquet in Paris at hfouquet1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fergal O'Brien at fobrien@bloomberg.net, Vidya RootFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.05,0.887,0.063,1

1184,0.9076,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump has been hunting for reasons to extract trade concessions from the European Union with the eagerness of a dog scrabbling around for a bone buried in the back yard.First came Germany’s $24 billion car trade surplus with the U.S., with Trump coming close to labeling the import of cars made by BMW AG, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG as a threat to America’s national security (before he granted a reprieve). Then there was a World Trade Organization ruling on Airbus SE’s long-running subsidy fight with Boeing Co., which gave the White House enough ammunition to threaten tariffs on at least $11 billion in European goods under the cloak of fair trade.Now U.S. officials have found a new angle of attack: European digital taxes, specifically France’s. The French are about to impose a 3% levy on sales made in the country by tech companies with more than 750 million euros ($845 million) of global revenue. The likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. have been up in arms about what they describe as an unfair tariff on Silicon Valley. And now they’ve been joined by their government, which is starting a probe of the French tax under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act, alleging harm against American interests.The choice of weapon is telling. Trump has used this type of inquiry against China to attack it with unilateral tariffs. This isn’t about patiently waiting for a ruling from the WTO, this is the stuff of trade wars.While the French initiative certainly has flaws, Paris is also being singled out for political and tactical reasons. Several other countries are introducing a digital tax too, and France would happily ditch its levy in favor of an OECD solution. What’s really motivating Trump’s team is the chance to drive a wedge between the French president Emmanuel Macron and his euro zone partners. Germany has held back from introducing a tech tax of its own, no doubt fearful of U.S. retaliation, while Ireland – whose low corporate tax rates are a magnet for tech giants – has fought hard against the idea. Remember too that Macron makes a virtue of opposing Trump. He was the only European leader to openly object to starting trade talks with the U.S., and he’s fighting to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive. The tech tax is just another way for Trump to apply counter-measures.What happens next is a big test of whether Europe will stand by France despite the obvious divide and rule tactics from the White House. The EU’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager had spoken approvingly of national digital taxes despite fears that they might distort competition, but her term ends soon. Europe’s leaders need to demonstrate that multilateralism still counts in an era of bilateral arm-twisting. In the longer term that means trying to maintain a global trading system (even a shrunken one) that’s based on shared values that run counter to Trump’s.Zaki Laidi, an international relations professor at Sciences Po in Paris, has called for a “Euro-Pacific Partnership,” bringing together Canada, the EU, and the remaining countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This would support the WTO (which is under siege by the Americans), comply with the Paris climate accords, and reform dispute settlement procedures rather than rip them up. As for tech, an EU or OECD agreement on digital taxes would make more sense than messy national solutions – and would avoid Trump’s opportunistic singling out of individual victims.Unfortunately, this is all easier said than done. The U.S. president is showing no signs of easing his tariff barrage and the trade-dependent EU economy is stuttering, making it easier for him to apply pressure. Trump is a true test of European unity, and Europe hasn’t passed it yet.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

1186,0.9808,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. is pressing China’s top smartphone vendors and app stores to boost the cut of revenue it gets from games sold through their platforms, people familiar with the matter said, stepping up efforts to claw back profits as its business slows.The social media giant is seeking as much as 70% of the sales generated from its games, up from just 50% now, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing private negotiations. That would bring Tencent’s portion in line with the proportion shared with game publishers on other platforms, including Apple Inc.’s iOS store and Google Play, which each keep 30% of revenue that comes from apps. Negotiations vary from platform to platform, and Tencent may not be asking as much from each app store operator, the people said.Tencent is keen to shore up its bottom line as growth in China, the world’s No. 2 economy, decelerates, sapping consumer spending on entertainment and hurting advertising. The company’s gaming division -- its largest -- was battered in 2018 by a series of regulatory crackdowns and in May, Tencent reported the smallest increase in sales since going public in 2004.At the same time, Tencent has gained leverage in negotiations because the pipeline of new games has shrunk, the result of Beijing’s clampdown on what it views as gaming addiction among youths. Fewer than 5,000 new games will be approved this year, versus more than 8,500 in 2017, Asia-focused gaming researcher Niko Partners estimates.Tencent “is likely to gain stronger bargaining power against its distribution channels,” Citigroup analysts led by Alicia Yap wrote in a research note this week.The social media titan initiated talks in recent weeks with most of the country’s largest app stores, run by leading smartphone makers such as Oppo, Lenovo Group Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp., as well as internet outfits such as Baidu Inc. and 360, the people said. Tencent is focusing on only a subset of its games at present, they added. But if the 70-30 split becomes the standard, that could translate into billions of dollars of additional revenue annually.Tencent dominates the market thanks to its all-purpose WeChat app, which serves more than a billion people, and a development machine that consistently cranks out hits such as Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite. Now, the company is taking advantage of its heft -- its closest rival is the much smaller NetEase Inc. -- to pressure app distributors to cough up more revenue, the people said.P.H. Cheung, a spokesman for Tencent, didn’t immediately respond to an email and text query on the company’s plans, which were previously reported by gaming industry media outlet Gamelook. Baidu and Oppo declined to comment.Those negotiations are by no means all one-sided. If anything, Tencent may have to work hard to change the status quo. The country’s four biggest smartphone names -- Oppo, Vivo, Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi -- run app stores for their users that together account for about 40% of market share.Among the new titles Tencent wants a bigger revenue cut on is role-playing mainstay JX Online 3, developed by China’s Kingsoft Corp., and Crazyracing Kartrider, a mobile remake of a popular title from South Korea’s Nexon Co., one person said. As of now, neither title is available on stores operated by Oppo and Vivo, suggesting those two device-makers have yet to agree to Tencent’s proposal.App developers and publishers compete to get games listed on those stores, whose operators host in-game payments for things such as virtual goods, character skins and power-ups. In return, developers get a cut of that revenue. Unlike in the U.S. and Europe, where a 70-30 split is common, revenue-sharing varies hugely across different Chinese stores but is commonly pegged at 50%. Furthermore, that cut is usually negotiated directly with each of the stores, sometimes on a game-by-game basis.What’s in the app stores’ favor is the sheer volume of competition. While Google Play is blocked in China, there are approximately 400 Android app stores, though many have an extremely small number of mobile users. The country’s app stores focus especially heavily on games because that’s where the money is -- many don’t even levy a cut of revenue at all on non-gaming apps.&#92;--With assistance from Lulu Yilun Chen.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.026,0.9,0.074,1

Fortunately, that was not the case today. Let's have a look at some of the big Wednesday winners. Oil WinnersIn late trading, two of the top four percentage gainers in the Dow were Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), the two largest U.S. oil companies. Those oil giants and others rallied after oil hit $60 per barrel.The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said domestic oil inventories slid by 9.5 million barrels last week, well above the forecast decline of 3.1 million barrels. Chevron and Exxon were also boosted by news that oil operators in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuating platforms there in anticipation of a storm in the region potentially becoming a hurricane. Marvelous MouseShares of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) jumped 1.56% as the company ascended to another record high. That is an impressive showing considering Goldman Sachs added Disney rival Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to its conviction buy list today. There was also some bullish commentary floating around about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), another Disney rival. Disney is up about 33% year-to-date, more than double the Dow's 2019 gain. Bank On BanksShares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) traded modestly lower today, but the largest U.S. bank was talked up by some traders expecting the stock to start showing some strength in advance of next Tuesday's second-quarter earnings report. Next week is an epic week in terms of earnings updates from the financial services sector, including some of that group's Dow components. Speaking Of Financials…Indeed an interesting segue into talking about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a technology stock, but the shares rose 0.99% today after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) said Apple Card, the company's credit card effort, could be a winner on multiple fronts.Notably, Morgan Stanley sees Apple Card holders spending more in high-margin Apple stores while indicating the new credit card could be a driver of growth for fintech platforms like Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Bottom LineWednesday's bottom line is pretty clear: the Fed still controls a significant part of the near-term outlook for riskier assets like stocks. On that front, the good news is that some market observers believe the possibility of a rate cut this month has been reborn following Powell's testimony today.Remember that Powell's congressional testimony continues tomorrow, and if he backs away from or affirms today's dovish statements, stocks will likely react in kind.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

1211,0.9875,"Shares in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) haven't been this hot in 20 years. Back then, Cisco briefly reigned as the world's most valuable company, its switches and routers being at the heart of this new thing called &quot;the internet.&quot;Source: Shutterstock Those days are gone, along with the sweet, sad song of your dial-up modem. But Cisco stock is up 33% so far in 2019. The bull run continued July 10 as analysts applauded its $2.6 billion buyout of Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA), due to close at the back end of a fiscal year that begins in August.Acacia was already supplying optical interconnects for Cisco switches.  Buying the company gives Cisco intellectual property it can use to keep selling gear to both the Cloud Czars and their retinue, the co-location sites, telcos and scaled enterprises that are constantly demanding more speed from their connections.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut is this an offensive or defensive move? Fighting HuaweiOf all the large U.S. tech companies, none is as much in the crosshairs of China's Huawei as Cisco.Huawei was the main target for President Donald Trump in the China trade war, but this week's relaxation of those sanctions means its lower-cost networking gear is back in the frame, at least for international buyers.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 The companies I call the Cloud Czars -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- are always focused on cutting costs in their data centers, where capital spending now costs $100 billion per year.Low-cost, commodity hardware built with open-source standards always has an advantage in this market, against any proprietary solution. Huawei sales have risen nearly 10-fold in the last decade.As the relationship between Huawei, with its low costs, and U.S. companies thaws, Cisco needs control of patented technology to stay relevant. The result has been a buying spree. It bought Duo Security last year for $2.35 billion in cash and stock; then chip maker Luxtera for $660 million in cash and assumed equity; and, now, Acacia. Cisco Stock Is Not CheapIndustry analysts and market analysts all approve this strategy, which is why Cisco is a hot stock.At around $57 per share, Cisco has a market cap of $244 billion. By some metrics, the price is still reasonable --  the trailing price-to-earnings ratio is under 20, and it offers a 35-cent quarterly dividend yielding 2.5%. But until this year, Cisco was considered a dividend aristocrat, not a growth play.As one analyst (OK, it was me) wrote last year, &quot;boring can be beautiful.&quot;  Even in May I called Cisco a conservative tech investment, suggesting you just put it in your pocket and let time work its magic.That article was published soon after I took my own advice and stuck some Cisco in my own retirement account, at about $51.40 according to my bookie. (OK, it was my broker.) I'm up 10% in three months, plus there's that dividend, still better than the 2.07% yield on a 10-year government bond. The Bottom LineCisco is still Cisco. It's not BeyondMeat (NASDAQ:BYND). This is not 1999. My red beard is not coming back.The moves CSCO stock has made in the last year, and the moves it will continue to make, are primarily defensive in nature. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins knows that, as hardware becomes software, maintaining a proprietary edge against low-cost solutions remains essential.That's going to cost money. Cisco is spending money. It had nearly $25 billion in cash and short-term securities in the bank as of March. Acacia represents just over 10% of that cash, a small price to pay for protecting its exposed flank.Just be aware. That flank remains exposed.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday.AirPods 3: It looks like Apple may be planning to launch new AirPods later this year, reports MacRumors. According to recent rumors, the tech company is planning to have the AirPods 3 ready for the 2019 holiday shopping season. The rumor says that these new earbuds will feature water and dust resistance. The current versions of the AirPods don't offer this, which makes them less than ideal for use while working out. Other rumors claim this update isn't coming out until next year.New iPads: Apple is apparently preparing to put out several new iPad tablets this year, 9to5Mac notes. Regulatory filings overseas have the company planning to release five new tablets. All of the devices in the filing are listed as running on iPadOS 13. The model numbers of these devices are A2197, A2228, A2068, A2198, and A2230.

1215,0.9568,"Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) has decided to turn away from Silicon Valley and back toward the car business for its future.VLKAY dropped their alliance with Aurora Innovation, a self-driving startup backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Instead it is now in talks with Ford (NYSE:F) for electric and autonomous car technology.Volkswagen's Modular Electric Drive Kit (MEB) will eventually be married to Argo AI, a start-up for autonomous vehicles Ford invested in back in 2017.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 The loser is Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo unit, which seems to have the best autonomous tech but whose proposed agreements were believed to be one-sided by the industry. Amazon and Aurora are still working with Korean nameplates Hyundai and Kia. Waymo is expected to wind up with Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi. The Ford/VLKAY DealUnder their deal, Ford and Volkswagen will place their strengths into one another's hands starting in 2022. Ford will make pick-ups for Europe under the VW nameplate, while VW will produce a city van Ford can sell. Volkswagen is going full speed ahead with the MEB platform in China, where a joint venture called SAIC Volkswagen will begin making up to 300,000 vehicles per year in 2020. Another joint venture, FAW-Volkswagen in Foshan, recently doubled its capacity to 600,000 vehicles, although some are gas-powered.For Volkswagen, its electric car alliances in China are a way to get past its Dieselgate scandal. The scandal led to the firing of Audi's CEO, over 7.000 layoffs, and tens of billions of dollars in fines and court costs.For Ford, the VW alliance gives it a stable electric vehicle platform and control over its path in self-driving cars. It could also bring Ford back into markets like Europe, South America, and Africa, from which it had been retreating. It's also a step back for CEO Jim Hackett, who was brought in two years ago in part because he had connections to Silicon Valley as head of Steelcase, a furniture company. What Comes NextVolkswagen is roughly twice the size of Ford. It has a market cap of about $86 billion, against $40 billion for Ford. Its sales last year came to about $264 billion, against $160 billion for Ford. Despite Dieselgate, VW sells for one-third its sales while Ford sells for one-fourth.The market poverty of the car business, compared with technology, where companies frequently sell for 8-10 times sales, has created an unequal balance. It may have led Waymo to push terms the auto industry could not abide. The car makers are now teaming up and sharing costs because, if they wanted, Waymo, Amazon, or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could build their own factories. The combined market cap of Ford and Volkswagen, about $120 billion, still pales in comparison to Amazon's $943 billion.The car makers insist no one has learned how to make money in electrics or autonomous cars. They insist even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hasn't cracked the puzzle, although its success in the luxury segment recently cost BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) CEO Harold Kruger his job. This came just months after BMW signed a manufacturing alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Bottom LineThe Ford-VW tie-up is a defensive alliance that boosts China and begins what may be the auto industry's last stand against Silicon Valley.Making electric cars takes fewer employees than making gas-powered cars. But autonomy remains a tough nut to crack. Tech companies believe they have the hole cards, but automakers want a better deal before they accept a back seat.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

1223,0.9931,"The following are not Dogs of the Dow stocks in 2019, but risky looking price charts hint at looming dogged price action in 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the always real possibility of these companies making that list next year is a strong reason to short MMM, CAT and AAPL stock today.Dow Jones stocks sometimes go up and at other times, they go down. Mostly these days, it happens to be the case the bulk of these blue-chips go up. For its part the bellwether average is up nearly 15% on the year and roughly 1% removed from its recent all-time-highs.At the same time, leading Dow constituents Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), American Express (NYSE:APX) and Visa (NYSE:V) are up roughly 30% to 35% in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe gains are certainly nice, as are AAPL stock's own outperformance of nearly 27%. Still, what goes up does eventually go down. And CAT stock's relative under-performance of 5% and MMM stock's decline of nearly 13.50% are testaments of this cyclical certainty. And if the price charts allow, sometimes investors are even offered a well-placed short stock opportunity.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on College Students' Radars With that in mind, MMM, CAT and AAPL stock are in this technically perilous situation right now and ready for shorting. And if today's bearish price patterns behave really dogged in 2019's second half, these three shorts might even land on next year's yield-driven Dogs of the Dow list for buying. 3M (MMM)  Click to Enlarge3M is our first bearish Dow Jones stock to short. MMM stock is the worst performer of today's three names. And right now, the chart is offering a good entry point to profit from continued weakness.The weekly chart points to MMM stock following through on the downside out of a bearish flag. The pattern has formed inside a former support area comprised of key Fibonacci levels which failed this past spring and have turned into staunch resistance.The MMM Stock TradeWith shares already confirming the pivot high within the bear flag and stochastics forming a bearish crossover from neutral levels, MMM stock looks like a short today. I'd suggest a stop loss of 8% to contain potential losses and smartly exit if resistance is overcome. Optimistically though, a profitable trend for bears could put shares back toward the 2016 lows near $125. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar is our next Dow Jones stock to short. CAT stock is already showing relative weakness this year. But if a weekly price chart showing lower highs and a couple bullish trend failures since late last year have any say, conditions are going to get worse.Bearish operators also have a nice spot to short this Dow Jones stock with limited risk and potentially outsized rewards. Following June's rally, shares have formed a pivot top within a countertrend rally against resistance.The CAT Stock TradeMy recommended strategy in CAT stock is to wait on a short through last week's topping candle low of $133.22. That price confirmation should also help a stochastics set-up that's currently on the cusp of turning lower and signaling a bearish crossover.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half For this Dow Jones stock short I'd suggest a 9% stop and size the position accordingly. Similar to MMM stock, this exit limits losses and closes the position if pattern resistance fails. On the downside, I'd look to take partial and much larger profits on a test of last year's corrective low near $110. Apple (AAPL)Apple is our third and final Dow Jones stock to short. AAPL stock's gains this year are nothing to sneeze at, but a second lower high pivot on the weekly view doesn't look good. And with price action set against a former trend line, the current cycle's 76% resistance level and a mostly favorable-looking stochastics position, an AAPL short looks even better.The AAPL Stock TradeWith Apple stock confirming a pivot high this week as shares moved through $200.65, shares could be shorted today while using a stop-loss above the pattern's candlestick high of $205.08.But I'd wait.Since this Dow stock finished Tuesday modestly above the short signal price, I like placing Apple shares on the radar for shorting on a bearish re-cross of $200.65 for additional confirmation. The entry is also contingent on last week's high remaining intact and of course, using it for keeping risk well-managed off and on the price chart.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

1230,0.9788,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s flagship central London retail store gets a new neighbor on Thursday, as Microsoft Corp. opens its inaugural European high-street presence just meters away.Microsoft has taken over three floors and 2,043 square meters (22,000 square feet) of a historic building on the corner of Regent Street and Oxford Street -- London’s central shopping thoroughfare -- originally designed in 1912, and which since 1996 had housed Benetton Group SpA’s main U.K. clothing outlet.“As we build our own hardware with Surface and expand our enterprise offerings, we’re finding that a physical location has been really valuable,” Microsoft Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said in an interview. “We’ve had a team working on this for multiple years now.”Technology giants’ push to open flashy stores to showcase their devices and software has proven to be one of the few bright spots for the U.K.’s ailing retail industry, which has been beset by bankruptcies, store closures and rent cuts. Pressure from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and a rise in costs stemming from the pound’s Brexit-induced weakness are crippling chain stores in particular.Apple stores are now among the biggest drivers of foot traffic to shopping malls, replacing department stores as the most sought after anchor tenants in new developments. Samsung Electronics Co. leased the anchor store in the upscale mall designed by Thomas Heatherwick that opened in London’s Kings Cross district last year to provide a showroom for its devices.Capossela said the years of planning to expand to Europe was not affected by observations of Britain’s ailing high streets, but rather from what it had learned by operating stores in the U.S. over the past 10 years.“We’re not doing a physical retail store because somebody else isn’t,” he said. “It’s really just an opportunity for us to serve a set of customers that want to know what’s going on at our company.”The new store blends white walls with wooden flooring and furniture, adding floor-to-ceiling video panels, laser-etching stations for product personalization, and a variety of conference rooms for training and education sessions.Customers can try out Microsoft’s Hololens augmented-reality headset, or pick up a new laptop or charging cable. But video-gamers and fans of the company’s Xbox platform get a large dedicated area just to themselves. A room filled with Xbox One consoles are also fitted with webcams and headsets to host in-store e-sports tournaments, and 98-inch screens dot most walls to entice popular streamers to showcase their presence at the site.“No other Microsoft store has the gaming lounge that this store has,” Capossela said. “There are gaming experiences here that are completely unique to London.”The building sits in one of the English capital’s most upmarket areas, Oxford Circus -- the busiest pedestrian crossing in Europe, according to Westminster City Council. It was designed by John Nash, the architect behind Buckingham Palace, which itself is just a short walk away from Microsoft’s new store.The CMO wouldn’t comment on whether the company planned on opening other stores in the U.K or Europe, or how long a lease it had committed to within the London building.&#92;--With assistance from Dina Bass and Jack Sidders.To contact the reporter on this story: Nate Lanxon in London at nlanxon@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.009,0.931,0.06,1

1234,0.9489,"Free cash flow (FCF) is one of the most important financial metrics you can study - especially if you're a buy-and-hold investor.FCF is the cash remaining after a company has paid its expenses, interest on debt, taxes and long-term investments to grow its business. And if a company generates more cash than it needs to run its business, it can do a number of useful things with it, such as pay dividends, buy back its stock, acquire other companies, expand its business and knock out its debts.There's no right answer as to the best way to use free cash flow. But the ability to consistently grow FCF over the long haul - however it's put to use - is a proven recipe for higher share prices.Pacer ETFs compiled FactSet data on the Russell 1000 between Dec. 31, 1991, and Dec. 31, 2018. It found that the 100 stocks with the highest free cash flow yields over this period delivered an annualized total return of 17% - almost seven times the annual returns of the 100 stocks with the worst FCF yields. In short, the higher the free cash flow yield, the better.With that in mind, let's look at 10 free cash flow stocks to buy for the long haul. These companies not only generate high amounts of FCF, but put it to good use via dividends, buybacks and more.

1236,0.9939,"Shares of global technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have surged higher in 2019. Year-to-date, AAPL stock is up more than 25% -- versus an 18% gain for the S&P 500 -- thanks to improving sentiment surrounding the company's growth prospects. Specifically, global macro-market and economic conditions have improved, while the iPhone business has shown signs of stabilizing, China demand has shown signs of rebounding, and the Services business has stayed in growth mode.Source: Shutterstock Net net, Apple stock has surged higher through the first six months of 2019, after a big drop in late 2018.But there's reason to believe that this recovery rally in Apple stock will run into some turbulence over the next few months. China demand issues are still being ironed out and will likely create weakness in second-half numbers. At the same time, with a 5G iPhone projected to release in the fall of 2020, the 2019 iPhone release could be disappointing. The combination of sluggish iPhone and China growth in the back-half of the year will likely weigh on AAPL stock in the near term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be sure, such near-term weakness is a long-term opportunity. China demand will come back into the picture, because the core growth fundamentals in China remain rock solid. iPhone demand will also re-accelerate in 2020 thanks to the launch of a 5G iPhone. Meanwhile, the Services business should stay in growth mode throughout all of this.Broadly, after a record rally to start 2019, Apple stock has turned into a near-term pain, long-term gain situation. The investment implication of this is clear. Don't get too excited about AAPL stock here and now at $200. But, if the stock continues to drop and sentiment grows more negative, be ready to buy the dip. Apple Stock May Struggle in the Back Half of 2019There's reason to believe that Apple stock, on the heels of a 25%-plus rally through the first six months of 2019, will trade largely sideways or lower over the next few months.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 There are three big things at play here. First, valuation. AAPL stock now features a 17.5 forward-earnings multiple. That is substantially above the five-year-average forward earnings multiple of 14. It's also worth noting that over the past few years, a forward earnings multiple north of 17.5 has been unsustainable and that whenever the stock did get that richly valued, it struggled for further gains.Second, sluggish iPhone growth. Apple is an iPhone-company, deriving around 50-60% of its revenue from the iPhone. Thus, as go iPhone growth trends, so goes AAPL stock. In the back half of 2018, iPhone growth trends were sluggish. AAPL stock slumped. In the first half of 2019, iPhone growth trends improved. AAPL stock surged.Looking into the back half of 2019, iPhone growth trends may go back to sluggish. The next big thing in the smartphone industry is 5G coverage. But, the consensus expectation is that a 5G iPhone won't hit shelves until fall of 2020. Thus, consumers will likely wait for that 5G iPhone in 2020, meaning demand for a new 2019 iPhone will be depressed. That will weigh on second-half 2019 iPhone growth trends.Third, sustained weak demand in China. China is Apple's third-biggest market, accounting for roughly 20% of revenues last year. But China demand has been weak lately, mostly due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing China economic expansion. Although trade tensions are cooling, it will take awhile for the Chinese consumer to shake off those tensions, and China demand in the back half of 2019 will likely remain weak.Overall, the optics here do not support the first-half surge in AAPL stock, repeating in the second half of the year. Apple Stock Will Rebound From These Near-Term StrugglesZooming out, second half 2019 struggles in AAPL stock will amount to nothing more than a long-term buying opportunity.In the big picture, there are two businesses here: the Products business and the Services business. On the Products side, you have the traditional hardware business (led by the iPhone, Mac, and iPad) and you have the new hardware business (led by the Apple Watch and Apple TV). The traditional hardware business will essentially be a zero-growth business over the next several years, as flattish unit growth converges on flattish pricing trends. The new hardware business, meanwhile, will likely be a mild revenue grower as wearables and smart accessory adoption continues to grow. Net net, the Products business projects as a zero- to slow-growth business over the next several years.On the Services side, you have Apple's suite of software subscription business like Apple Music, News+, Arcade and more. The sum of these services are growing rapidly. Last quarter, Services revenue rose 16%. Year to date, Services revenue is up 18%. Growth in this segment will remain in the 10%-plus range going forward as the company's TV and video game services gain subscribers and traction.Thus, Apple going forward is defined by one part slow-growth Products business, and one part 10%-plus-growth Services business. Importantly, Products presently account for 85% of revenues. Thus, Apple's overall revenue growth rate will look more like the sluggish Products growth rate than the robust Services growth rate. Reasonably speaking, this is a 3-4% revenue growth company over the next several years.Also of note, the Services business has much higher gross margins (63% in 1H19) than the Products business (33%). As the Services business continues to grow faster than than the Products business, and comprises a bigger and bigger slice of the revenue pie, that will drive overall gross margins higher and be additive to profit growth. That margin expansion dynamic on top of continued big buybacks will likely turn 3-4% revenue growth, into ~10% EPS growth.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Projecting that out, $20 in EPS seems doable for Apple by fiscal 2025. Based on a market-average 16 forward multiple, this implies a fiscal 2024 price target for AAPL stock of $320, meaning that this stock has healthy upside potential in a long-term window. Bottom Line on AAPL StockAfter a big rally through the first half of 2019, Apple stock has turned into a near-term pain, long-term gain situation. Such situations are easily translated into investment action. Be cautious in the near term. Let the stock come down over the next few months. Then, buy the dip as sentiment inflects into negative territory and the stock becomes far too discounted for its own good.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tough Year Apple has long been both one of the safest bets on the market. But this has just not been their year. At the start of 2019, CEO Tim Cook admitted that first-quarter earnings would be a projected $84 billion. That sounds great, but this was a downgrade from an initial $93 billion. This was the first time Apple decreased revenue expectations in 16 years. And Now Three analysts at Rosenblatt Securities now rate Apple's shares a &quot;sell,&quot; and another 18 analysts have Apple as &quot;hold” (kinda the same thing to many). But buck up, Tim: 23 analysts still think Apple is a &quot;buy.&quot; What’s with the sluggish growth? China Doesn’t Like It Like most worldwide companies, Apple relies heavily on the Chinese market. Unfortunately, the Chinese just aren’t feeling the new iPhone XS all that much. While Apple’s unique iOS operating system is huge in America and Europe, in China they much prefer WeChat, which works on both IOS and Android phones, and is therefore available as a much cheaper alternative that still lets users do all the normal iStuff (bills, cabs, e-mails etc.). iFatigue Since the debut of the iPhone in 2007, Apple could rely on a set of consumers who would eagerly purchase the latest model whenever it hit the market. But as New York argued last year, at this point, most people view their iPhone as akin to household appliances. No one gets psyched when a new microwave model hits the market, right? You’d rather just ride your current one out until it breaks. Same for the iPhone. It doesn’t help that the current $1,000 plus price point for the new iPhone, is just a littie much for a lot of people these days. Why is everyone freaking out? Well, Apple is so huge that whatever affects it has ripples for the entire economy. The S&P; dropped .5% yesterday as well. To give you some perspective, Apple has lost $452 billion in market capitalization since Oct. 3. of last year, its shares falling more than 39% percent. As CNBC pointed out, Apple has basically lost revenue bigger than some companies total worth. Put it another way: Apple has lost a Facebook and a McDonald’s three times over. -Michael Tedder Photo: Joshua Roberts/REUTERS",0.071,0.822,0.107,1

With shares up 28% year-to-date, but having gone nowhere since late April, it's a good time to reassess the situation.Source: Shutterstock Things took a turn for the worse when Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang downgraded shares of the consumer tech giant to a &quot;sell.&quot; Citing a pressured environment for the company's flagship iPhone, Zhang forecasts headwinds against total revenue growth. As a result of the bearish note, the Apple stock price closed down 2% to start the week.Specifically, Zhang called out the iPhone XS, fearing that it could be &quot;one of the worst-selling iPhone models in the history of Apple.&quot; Moreover, Apple's other hardware products, such as the iPad and HomePod, may not provide meaningful revenue support. Obviously, this was a rough Monday for AAPL stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd Zhang isn't incorrect to bring up these concerns. For instance, Apple's iPad, while a cute toy to play around with, hasn't truly resonated with consumers. Sales for the iconic tablet peaked in 2014. Additionally, Samsung was neck-and-neck with Apple in terms of global smartphone market share earlier this decade. However, the latter took the lead and never looked back.Dependency on the iPhone was a strong suit for Apple stock. Now, it's a liability.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 At the same time, Chinese consumers still love their iPhones. And Wedbush analyst Dan Ives argues that 60 to 70 million customers could need an upgrade soon.Is it premature to go bearish on AAPL stock? The Growth Narrative for AAPL Stock Appears StretchedBefore we dive into the above question, let's take care of some housekeeping. First, don't misunderstand the broader point: AAPL stock isn't a convincing bearish trade. It's very close to a $1 trillion market capitalization. Plus, the company is overflowing with cash.In other words, management has many levers to lift the Apple stock price should the need arise.But it's also fair to point out that AAPL stock doesn't have a convincing bullish argument at the moment, either. I agree with Ives that the Apple brand resonates with Chinese buyers. It was an underlying narrative a few years ago, and it remains intact today.However, I'm more interested in the stories that the numbers weave. Here, the hard data confirms Zhang's &quot;sell&quot; recommendation. No matter how you look at it, iPhone sales have matured. Any further progress will require a costly investment. Unfortunately, even with China in the picture, the Asian juggernaut can't support Apple stock, let alone skyrocket it.A helpful illustration is the business growth curve, or S-curve. In a nutshell, massive growth occurs in the infancy and expansion stages. Later, in the maturation phase, growth slows due to a lack of new customers.  Click to EnlargeIt's exactly what we're seeing now with iPhone unit sales. From the third-quarter 2008 through Q3 2009, year-over-year (YOY) iPhone sales growth averaged 303%. From Q4 2009 through Q2 2012, that growth rate remained a very respectable 88%.But from Q3 2012 onward? Shockingly, growth slipped to just under 12%. We're also at a point where we're seeing negative growth in some quarters on a YOY basis. That tells me that the party is over for the iPhone; hence, Zhang's downgraded expectations for the Apple stock price. Historical Leverage to the iPhone Haunts Apple StockMany bulls might counter that the iPhone tells only chapter of the story. Obviously, Apple has many other products and services. Thus, it's not all doom and gloom for AAPL stock.I'll reiterate that doom and gloom isn't my agenda at all. Rather, I'm just approaching Apple from a rational perspective. In the analyst sphere, we have two competing perspectives. I believe that one side has the better argument and evidence.The other reason to not dive too deeply into AAPL stock is the revenue allocation. In recent years, the iPhone represented roughly two-thirds of total Apple revenue. That has dipped significantly but nevertheless, the flagship smartphone still accounts for the majority of sales.  Click to EnlargeUnder this context, it's no surprise that Apple revenues have also hit the S-curve's maturity phase. Earlier this decade, quarterly sales witnessed YOY growth that hit strong double digits. Now, the growth rate risks falling toward single digits.While Apple was busy producing the next iteration of the iPhone, they should have conceived a viable alternative product. That they failed in this endeavor is the real reason why the bears hold their negative perspective. The Apple stock of old is nothing like it is today.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1272,0.9894,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched its new Ryzen 3000 series processors and Navi-based Radeon 5700 series graphics cards this week. Both new releases are critical, and fortunately for both the company and those owning AMD stock, early reviews are glowing.With the first hands-on review of the Ryzen 3000 processors and Radeon 5700 graphics cards landing on Sunday, Advanced Micro Devices stock started the week off with a 1.71% gain. Price Cuts and DramaThere was a little drama prior to the official release of the new AMD silicon. The company announced a price cut of $50 for its new graphics cards just two days before the launch. That was in response to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has been trying to spoil the launch with the announcement of GeForce RTX Super cards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile analysts often see pre-release price cuts as troubling, in this case it seems to have been interpreted as a sign that Advanced Micro Devices is going to be aggressive in taking on Nvidia. Instead of taking a hit on the price cut news, AMD stock gained 64 cents on Friday. On Sunday, AMD put out a press release announcing the launch of its new graphics cards and processors, calling the combination the &quot;Ultimate PC Gaming Platform.&quot; It also announced buyers of the new graphics cards will get a free 3-month Xbox Game pass with access to over 100 PC games.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half That wording may have confused some casual observers. After months of headlines about new subscription gaming services from the likes of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), &quot;Ultimate PC Gaming Platform&quot; almost sounded like AMD was announcing a new service of its own. That was likely intentional. However, the company was referring to the combination of the new Radeon 5700 graphics cards and Ryzen 3000 processors as offering a new best-in-class PC gaming experience.  Positive Reviews Help AMD Stock Price to PopThe key to how well Advanced Micro Devices stock is going to perform for the rest of this year is reviews. How well do the new products compare against market leaders Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)?The early reviews went live on Sunday once embargo was lifted, and the news was just what AMD investors have been hoping to hear. Reviews of the Ryzen 3000 processors have been positive, with many noting that for the first time in more than a decade AMD is no longer trying to catch Intel in the PC space, it's now on an equal footing--or better.The reviews of the Radeon 5700 graphics cards are even more glowing. Tom's Hardware pitted the AMD Radeon 5700XT against Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 2060 Super and found the new Radeon achieved frame rates nearly 10% higher than the competition. The review notes, &quot;The Radeon RX 5700s serve up almost universally better performance than competing GeForce RTX 2060s at the same prices.&quot;The positive reviews for the new CPUs and graphics cards that hit on Sunday helped AMD stock to pop on Monday, with a 1.71% gain on the day.  AMD Stock Outperforming RivalsThe performance of AMD's new lineup against its two arch rivals reflects their market performance so far in 2019. AMD stock is up 84.5% so far this year. NVDA is also up, but more modestly at 17.5%, while INTC has eked out 1.8% growth. All of these stocks have been negatively affected to some degree by the trade war with China and the threat of increased tariffs. But where Intel and Nvidia are focused on trying to hold their own against a surging and aggressive rival, Advanced Micro Devices is winning reviews, winning headlines and positioned to be winning new customers. And that should keep the AMD stock growth story going in 2019.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Courts in both the U.S. and the U.K. have hurt the company's continuing bid to extend its reach and revenue. Despite the bad news, Amazon stock has not been greatly affected by it.Source: Shutterstock With Prime Day near and Amazon stock back near its all-time highs, traders seem unconcerned about the company's  revenue. I don't expect these legal setbacks to have a major impact on AMZN going forward. As a result, the lack of a pullback by AMZN may disappoint Amazon bulls hoping for a buying opportunity,  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019  Courts on Both Sides of the Atlantic Rule against AmazonMuch like Amazon's mega-tech counterparts Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), court-related challenges have begun to plague AMZN. Thanks to a federal appeals court ruling, courts can now hold Amazon liable for products sold by third parties. Third-party sales account for about 58% of the sales on Amazon's platform.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRetail remains a thin-margin business. However, due to the fees AMZN collects from third-party sales, it earns higher margins from such transactions than from the sales of its own products.AMZN's legal struggles affect it outside of the United States. In the U.K., the nation's Competition and Markets Authority has ordered Amazon to pause its investment in a grocery-delivery startup called Deliveroo. As the justification of its decision, the regulator cited &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe the companies would not remain distinct if Amazon moves forward with the investment. The Legal Setbacks  Have Not and Should Not Hurt Amazon StockBut in a blow to those hoping for a buying opportunity, AMZN stock seems to have been mostly unaffected by the news. Although rulings that limit the growth of its retail business could lower its revenue growth, most of the company's profit comes from its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, its latest source of profits -- selling ads on its platform -- should only  be minimally affected by legal setbacks. As a result, the company's legal difficulties may not have as much of an impact on its earnings as some might anticipate.Moreover, Amazon stock is trading at a more reasonable valuation than in the past. Due to the struggles of Amazon stock over the past year, its price-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen out of the stratosphere. On a forward basis, AMZN's PE ratio is now about 50.8 . With analysts, on average, predicting that AMZN's profits will rise  35.6% this year and 40.1% in fiscal 2020, AMZN stock  should continue to attract many buyers. Prime Day Will Also Be a Positive Catalyst for Amazon StockFurther, investor attention remains focused not on courts, but on Amazon Prime Day. Prime Day will begin on July 15 and run for 48 hours. No research firm has released an estimate for Prime Day sales. However, in 2018, the event brought in $4.2 billion of revenue, coming in 74% higher than Prime Day in 2017.AMZN is offering more discounts this year than in previous years,  and it will hire celebrities to promote the event. Final Thoughts on Amazon StockThanks to both the structure of the company and Prime Day, Amazon stock should not be affected much by the company's legal struggles.There are reasons to be concerned about adverse rulings that can hurt the company's third-party retail business. However, the cloud and ads generate most of its profits. If liability or antitrust issues impact its retail business and weigh on Amazon stock, long-term AMZN bulls will get a good buying opportunity . But judging by the recent behavior of Amazon stock, everyone seems too focused on Prime Day to worry about legal setbacks.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

1287,-0.917,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock continues to be volatile. Since mid-April, QCOM stock has moved from $55 to $88, to $65 to $70, before settling in at a current price above $76. But while the recent shifts are larger than usual, QCOM stock has seen big moves for several years now.For the last five years, Qualcomm stock has mostly moved sideways -- the stock was actually down 6% over that period -- but with a number of peaks and valleys along the way. QCOM stock has been a trader's darling for two key reasons.First, Qualcomm is a leader in chips used for smartphones. Key customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its stock significantly outperform QCOM. But it, too, has seen a few sharp moves. Investor attitudes toward Apple have risen and fallen along with the company's product cycle -- and QCOM in some cases has gone along for the ride.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, Qualcomm's business model has been under various forms of attack for most of that period. And it has been the effectiveness of those attacks, and the threat of new ones, that has driven investors in and out of Qualcomm stock.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 That hasn't changed in 2019. If anything, the debate over Qualcomm's model has intensified. Understanding that debate is essential to understanding QCOM stock. Antitrust Concerns Are Nothing NewRegulators have had their eyes on Qualcomm for years. The European Commission, driven by complaints from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and others, began its initial antitrust probe back in 2005. The investigation was eventually canceled in 2009 after the complaints were withdrawn.One reason those complaints were withdrawn, however, was that the suppliers managed a win in South Korea. In 2009, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $207 million (the figure was reduced by about 18% this year) for unfairly using its dominance in mobile phone chips. With customers moving on to new chips, the changes driven by South Korea's action and the resources used in Europe led the claimants to move on.Regulators in Asia and Europe weren't finished, however. In 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million to settle antitrust litigation in China -- the largest fine in that country's history. The next year, South Korea hit the company again, this time for $853 million.A new investigation in Europe ended with a $1.2 billion levy in 2018. Another fine reportedly is on the way. Taiwan got $774 million last year as well. All told, Qualcomm has paid nearly $4 billion in antitrust fines worldwide. What Regulators Are Saying About QCOMThe fine print of the allegations vary modestly from country-to-country, but the basic complaint is the same: Qualcomm is using its patent power to cement its monopoly. As EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager put it last year:&quot;Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance. Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals.&quot;The problem in regulators' view is that Qualcomm charges for its chips -- but it also charges to license the associated patents. It then provides rebates that are conditioned on exclusively buying Qualcomm products. Regulators argue that those rebates, in particular, keep potential rivals -- among them Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- out of the mobile baseband chip market.The problem for Qualcomm here is twofold: First, it risks more fines in new jurisdictions. Second, this system is quite profitable for Qualcomm. As Apple has termed it, Qualcomm is &quot;double dipping&quot; in gaining both product and licensing revenue. Losing that ability would hurt Qualcomm revenue and profits.Most notably, the company's licensing revenue is extremely high-margin. In fiscal 2017, pre-tax profit margins (not gross margins -- operating margins, essentially) in the licensing business were 80%. Every dollar of licensing revenue lost suggests, even after taxes, close to 70 cents of lost net income. It's not a surprise, then, that investors showed caution toward Qualcomm stock as antitrust questions piled up. Apple Takes on QualcommWhat really got investor attention, however, wasn't a regulator, but a customer. Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion in early 2017, kicking off a bruising legal battle. QCOM stock dropped 12% on the news, as Apple accused the company of inflating royalties. Qualcomm countersued. Apple instructed contract manufacturers like Foxconn Technology (OTCMKTS:FXCOF) to withhold royalties, which hammered Qualcomm profits.Qualcomm stock would hit a 20-month low later in 2017. A takeover attempt by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) spiked the stock -- but in March 2018, President Donald Trump quashed the deal, and QCOM stock hit the lows again. Another rally would fade along with a sell-off in semiconductor stocks. By February of this year, QCOM was back below $50.Apple's efforts hurt Qualcomm earnings and putting pressure on QCOM shares. Then, out of nowhere, Apple settled. The risk of a loss in that case -- which could color antitrust sentiment worldwide -- came off the table. Billions of dollars in back payments were set to flow into Qualcomm's coffers.QCOM stock gained 23% on the first day and kept rising. It would barely clear $90 in May, if briefly. At that point, Qualcomm stock had risen almost 60% in just a couple of weeks. Over that span, Qualcomm added nearly $40 billion in market value.It appeared as if the worst was over. Antitrust issues overseas had been largely settled. Apple (including its contract manufacturers) and Samsung combined generated 40% of revenue in fiscal 2016 -- and Qualcomm was apparently on good terms with both key customers. 5G was on the way. The naysayers had been proven wrong. After years of volatile and sideways trading, Qualcomm was set to jump-start growth. The U.S. Gets Involved With QCOM AntitrustA lot of news surrounded Qualcomm from 2017 to 2018. There were antitrust fines in Taiwan and Europe. Broadcom was trying to buy Qualcomm, while Qualcomm was trying to buy NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in a deal that eventually broke after some 20 months of effort. The Qualcomm-Apple battle garnered headlines. And there were the arguments about the fate of smartphone unit growth -- a key source of pressure on Apple stock -- and the timing and size of the opportunity in 5G.Amid all that action, investors somewhat forgot that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had decided to get in on the antitrust action. The FTC charged Qualcomm with anticompetitive behavior in January 2017. Two days later, the Apple suit was filed. Headlines surrounding that battle somewhat displaced the FTC effort.And as the case dragged on, its relevance seemed minimal. Qualcomm stock had not been very impacted by past antitrust settlements; even a U.S. effort would be much the same. Settlement talks were held last October, suggesting the pending removal of yet another headwind to QCOM stock.That analysis turned out to be wrong, however. QCOM stock had one more big move in it. A Monopoly Ruling, and QCOM Stock TumblesOn May 21, U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of the FTC. Qualcomm stock already had been struggling amid the Huawei blacklist and generally weak sentiment toward semiconductor stocks. It would fall 11% in trading the day after Koh's ruling.Koh found that Qualcomm's &quot;no license, no chips&quot; policy was anti-competitive. The judge cited three reasons:First, Qualcomm refused to allow rivals licenses to standard-essential patents (SEPs). That meant that end customers like Apple or Samsung had to license those patents from Qualcomm even if they used chips from another customer.Second, the rates it charged for those SEPs were &quot;unreasonably high,&quot; as the judge wrote in her opinion. On occasion, Koh wrote, Qualcomm charged higher licensing fees when manufacturers used other chips -- in a clear effort to prevent those customers from doing so.Third, the rebates and market share discounts offered by Qualcomm further harmed competition, allowing Qualcomm to use its existing market share to prevent competitors from entering.Koh clearly had the famous Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) antitrust case in mind; she cites that case liberally in her decision. From a broad standpoint, her argument is much the same: Smartphone manufacturers need Qualcomm modems just like PC manufacturers needed the Microsoft operating system. And, like Microsoft in the 1990s, Qualcomm has capitalized on that need to generate more revenue than it would have otherwise -- and to keep its competitors from having a piece of the market. The Importance of SEPs and FRANDParticularly in the context of Apple settling with Qualcomm, Koh's argument appears quite thin at first glance. As the patent holder, isn't Qualcomm entitled to monetize the IP which it spent -- and still spends -- billions of dollars developing? Why, exactly, can the government decide what licensing rates are &quot;unreasonably high&quot;?It's because of the importance of SEPs. The standards created in tech industries, in particular, generally are set by standard-setting organizations, or SSOs. These efforts are hugely important to ensure that an iPhone can call a Samsung, and vice versa. Without agreed-upon industry standards, interoperability would be significantly hampered -- causing harm to consumers and businesses alike.As Koh notes on page 125 of her decision, the Microsoft case is instructive. The Ninth Circuit held that &quot;SSOs requir[e] members who hold IP rights in standard-essential patents to agree to license those patents to all comers on [FRAND] terms (emphasis in original).&quot;As part of those SSOs, Qualcomm agreed to abide by those rules. It can't charge whatever it wants for licensing. It can't coerce or entice customers to exclusively use its chips. FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) pricing prevails.This is the case antitrust authorities have made against Qualcomm in so many overseas jurisdictions. It's the argument Apple made as well. A U.S. judge has taken their side, which projects an enormous impact on Qualcomm's business model. What That Means for Qualcomm StockMake no mistake: Koh's ruling will be trouble for Qualcomm if it is upheld. Licensing revenue would take a hit -- and that's a problem. Going back to fiscal 2016, before the Apple battle led to lower licensing revenue, the importance of licensing is apparent.Qualcomm's QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) unit generated $15.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year as shipments fell. Its pre-tax margins were 12%. Segment profit was $1.81 billion.QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) revenue came in at $7.6 billion -- less than half that of QCT. But margins were a staggering 85%. That business generated profit of $6.53 billion.In other words, licensing accounted for 78% of total earnings. Even in FY18, with Apple's suppliers withholding billions of dollars in revenue, QTL still generated 54% of the company's profit. Those total profits, at the segment level, unsurprisingly were 22% lower than they were two years ago -- in large part due to Apple's withdrawal.Licensing revenue is massively important to QCOM's bottom line. But Koh's ruling could suggest that Qualcomm can't license its patents and sell its chips to the same customer for the same reasons. That would lower sales and reduce licensing revenue, the most profitable revenue Qualcomm has -- and in fact the most profitable revenue pretty much anyone in tech has.Qualcomm might have to lower its rates for other customers. The company would also have to license its technology to rivals, potentially allowing Intel and others into the baseband modem space. Given that Intel's weakness appears to be the key reason why Apple settled in the first place, that suggests more competition as well.Lower sales, lower margins, and more competition: it's a tough combination for Qualcomm. A Short Seller Highlights the Risk to Qualcomm StockBack in January, Kerrisdale Capital released its short case for QCOM stock based on the prediction that Qualcomm would lose in court. The firm estimated a revenue loss of $2.7 billion: 12% of fiscal 2018 sales. It projected that such a hit would lead EPS to plunge to $1.64 annually, due, again, to the impact on margins.As such, Kerrisdale concluded, QCOM stock potentially could fall as far as $21. That's not far off from back-of-the-envelope calculations that assume a roughly 13x P/E multiple broadly in line with the likes of INTC and AVGO.That seems too bearish at this point. The Apple settlement changes the calculations, though it's possible Apple could look to renegotiate should the FTC prevail. And it's unwise to simply take a short-seller's word for it: Kerrisdale had some big wins, but it famously erred with Straight Path Communications, acquired by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) after a bidding war with AT&T (NYSE:T).That said, Kerrisdale's broad point still holds -- and the firm is not alone in making it. Several Wall Street analysts cut their targets after Koh's decision to adjust for the new risk. An antitrust loss will irrevocably change Qualcomm's business model, hurting both revenue and earnings. Investors can -- and will -- argue about the exact impact going forward, but there will be an impact. Can Qualcomm Win on Appeal?Of course, that assumes that Qualcomm winds up losing for good -- which is not guaranteed. Last week Koh refused a request to stay the decision. Qualcomm said in response that it will ask the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for an appeal, a process that could take a year or more on its own.And it's possible Qualcomm will win. More than a few legal experts have criticized Koh's logic. Most notably, an FTC Commissioner writing on her own behalf in the Wall Street Journal said the decision &quot;radically expanded a company's legal obligations to help its competitors.&quot; Even the Department of Justice has taken a notably different stance from its fellow regulatory agency.Other legal experts argue that Koh overreached. USC law professor Jonathan Barnett criticized the decision in an op-ed in The Hill on that basis. Barnett made a point echoed elsewhere: if Qualcomm's behavior was so anti-competitive, why have smartphone prices generally declined (at least outside of the iPhone)?It's exceedingly difficult to argue that end smartphone customers are somehow being deprived. Prices in many cases (particularly for Asian manufacturers) are declining. Innovation is proceeding at a breathtaking pace.Meanwhile, as others have pointed out, Apple -- the company likely most reliant on Qualcomm -- switched its baseband modem business to Intel. It's not Qualcomm's fault that effort failed. If anything, it highlights the fact that Qualcomm's R&D efforts are substantial -- and successful. It makes a better modem than Intel could. Should Qualcomm be punished for that? Where QCOM Sits NowIt's worth noting that, at the moment, QCOM stock sits only modestly below where it traded before Koh's decision was released. That doesn't necessarily mean that the market thinks the decision will be reversed.There has been good news elsewhere: The Huawei ban has been lifted, if partially. Chip stocks, helped recently by big earnings from Micron (NASDAQ:MU), have rallied.But there is a case that investors are being a little too sanguine relative to the antitrust risk. Qualcomm stock isn't necessarily expensive, at about 15x FY20 EPS estimates. Apple revenue should help growth beyond that as well. But 15x for a chip stock isn't cheap, even if a 3.2% dividend yield does help the case. INTC is at 11x CY20 EPS estimates, and AVGO at about 12x.Qualcomm stock is getting a premium -- and litigation risk aside, maybe it should. 5G is a bigger driver for Qualcomm than anything Intel has. Qualcomm has no competitors along the lines of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Broadcom thought Qualcomm was worth $82 per share -- and Qualcomm itself didn't believe that was enough. For the current business model, QCOM stock might be attractive at these levels (though it was more so at $65 just a few weeks ago). The Antitrust RiskTo own Qualcomm stock here, an investor has to have some faith that the antitrust case won't be a big deal. That seems too optimistic. It's easy to say that Microsoft weathered its own antitrust suit well, given that it is again heading toward a trillion-dollar market cap. But MSFT stock spent over a decade in the metaphorical desert after the resolution of its suit and the collapse of the dot-com boom.The FTC represents a very real threat to Qualcomm -- not just in terms of another potential fine. The business model that has cemented the company's dominance and driven some of the highest margins in the industry is at stake. Whatever the true financial impact of a permanent change would be, it will be significant. And investors, at the very least, need to understand that risk.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

1288,0.9977,"It’s that time of year again, when publicly traded companies have to live up to the ‘public’ part of that phrase – earnings season, in short, when investors get to see the nuts and bolts performance numbers of their favorite companies.So far, the early estimates are looking grim. Of the S&P 500 components that have released preliminary data, 80% have slashed their earnings forecasts. Three tech giants, however, are looking upbeat, and forecasting good reports for the just-ended fiscal quarter. We’ve dipped into the TipRanks database to get the latest analyst reviews on the largest names in high-tech. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Microsoft, the old boy in the tech industry, has gained more than 34% so far this year, nearly doubling the S&P 500’s own brisk 18% pace. This rapid growth has put Microsoft in an exclusive club: it is only the third publicly traded company to break $1 trillion in total market cap, a milestone it reached in mid-June. Microsoft now has a valuation just under $1.06 trillion, ahead of Amazon’s (AMZN) $960 billion and Apple’s (AAPL) $920 billion.The company’s success has come from solid performance in its various segments – legacy customers, Office 365, and Azure, combined with excitement over the upcoming public beta release of the new xCloud gaming service. Microsoft shows that a mega-cap company can combine the steady returns of a blue-chip stock with high-tech cutting-edge products and enthusiasm.Microsoft reports fiscal Q4 earnings on July 18, and the general view is that the company will justify its sky-high valuation. EPS is expected at $1.21, a 7% gain from the year-ago quarter, with revenues to come in at $32.75 billion, 8.8% over last year’s Q4. While high, these gains represent a slowdown from Q3’s 14% growth, so any forecast beat will be welcomed by market watchers.Mark Moerdler, writing from Bernstein, sees the cloud bringing MSFT $140 billion in long-term sales, a solid foundation for further growth. He says, “Microsoft has distinct advantages in portions of the market that should give the company the ability to reach, over time, revenue that is not that dissimilar to that of [Amazon Web Services].” Looking ahead to the future of cloud computing, Moerdler expects that Microsoft will emerge as one of two or three mega-cap companies dominating the sector. With that in mind, he gives MSFT a $152 price target and an 11% upside potential.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives describes Microsoft’s position for 2H19 and 2020 as “enviable,” saying that the company is “firing on all cylinders around its Office 365 and Azure strategic vision.” Ives adds, “The shift to cloud is a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting Microsoft in the field and should continue its momentum heading into the next 12-18 months.” With a price target of $155, he sees a 13% upside to MSFT.Microsoft’s analyst consensus rating is a strong buy; the company has 21 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell assigned in the last three months. The average price target is $144, with an upside of 5.14%. MSFT shares are selling for $136.View MSFT Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)At number two in total market cap, and the dominant player in online retail, Amazon is not worried about earnings, to be reported on July 25. The forecast calls for increases in both revenues and EPS. Revenues are predicted to come in 4.6% higher than last quarter, at $62.46 billion, while EPS is expected to show a higher gain, over 18%, with a bottom-line number of $5.58 per share. Last quarter, Amazon’s EPS of $7.09 represented a 35% beat of the forecast.Wall Street’s top analysts are also confident of Amazon’s earnings success. From Cowen, John Blackledge gives the stock a $2,500 price target and 28% upside, saying, “The company’s move to Prime 1-day delivery will drive higher conversion rates, leading to increasing unit growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020.” He believes Prime 1-day has revenue potential of $1 billion to $2 billion this year.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler believes Amazon will report revenue acceleration in the fiscal second quarter. He says that, “the combination of core retail picking up slightly earlier in Q2 and the extra 3%-4% to run-rate from next day shipping should take Amazon's growth rates up from Q1.” Accordingly, he keeps his buy rating on the stock, although his price target is a more modest $2.050Amazon’s overall rating, based on an analyst consensus of 35 buys and 1 hold, is a ‘Strong Buy.’ The stock is selling for an eye-watering $1,956, so the average price target of $2,243 suggests an upside potential of 14%.View AMZN Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Like it’s mega-cap peers, Apple is looking at a strong quarterly report on July 30. The expected EPS is $2.10, slightly lower than last quarter, while revenues are forecast at a healthy $53.35 billion. Now that trade tensions between the US and China have eased, and the threat of further tariffs has faded for the present, Apple’s performance in the Chinese smartphone market remains the wildcard. iPhone holds a 9% to 10% market share in China; the earnings forecast is based on the Apple maintaining that niche.While Apple has been publicly shifting toward a model based on increased services, the iPhone remains the company’s largest revenue generator. This is reflected in the analyst comments on the stock. Daniel Ives, quoted above regarding Microsoft, says that Wedbush’s recent market research “suggests stable Apple iPhone demand globally heading into the crucial September quarter, that he would characterize as better than feared.” Ives gives Apple at price target of $235, suggesting 17% upside.Samik Chatterjee, of JPMorgan, describes is attitude toward Apple’s 2020 volume outlook for iPhone shipments as “incrementally positive.” He says, “Global supply chain and smartphone channel checks suggest that Apple is likely to pull an additional lever in the form of a refresh of the legacy iPhone SE/iPhone 8 model to address a value category.” He believes that next year’s positive volume outlook will drive upgrades to meet consensus earnings expectations and boost AAPL shares. In line with this, he sees 2020 full year earnings hitting $13 and 2021 earnings reaching $15.30.Company guidance in the coming quarterly report will show if Chatterjee’s estimates are in line. His price target, $239, indicates confidence in a 19% upside to the stock.AAPL’s ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus rating is based on 19 buys, 14 holds, and 3 sells. Shares are priced at $200 with an average target of $216, an 8% upside for the stock.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailVisit TipRanks’ Stock Screener to find out more about the vital stats of these three stocks, and more.",0.017,0.882,0.101,1
1289,0.9973,"It has been called the 800-pound gorilla in the room: Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), the world's biggest weed company by market cap ($14 billion), industry presence and sheer volume of cannabis production. A weed leader and undisputed heavyweight champion of pot stocks, CGC stock was the very first cannabis company to list on the New York Stock Exchange and continues to be heavily traded in both Canada and the United States.Source: Shutterstock I suppose you could say it's the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of cannabis stocks, but does that necessarily make Canopy Growth stock the best pot stock pick? After all, CGC isn't exactly the cheapest one on the market, and you know the old saying: &quot;The bigger they are, the harder they fall.&quot; Can It Get Any Bigger?With a massive $4 billion capital infusion from alcoholic beverage mega-corporation Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), Canopy has more than enough capital and market share to dominate the Canadian weed space. While I can't predict exactly how Canopy will use those funds, I expect that the company may invest in the fast-growing edibles space as well as the international pot market as there are more than 30 countries currently pursuing a medical cannabis program.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe counter-argument among Canopy's critics is that a company of this size risks collapsing under its own weight. My reply is that just as the e-commerce space continues to grow (thus enabling Amazon to continue expanding), the global cannabis market has plenty of room to grow and Canopy Growth will, at least for the foreseeable future, have no shortage of new frontiers to conquer. Still the Revenue KingWhenever I evaluate a company, one of my prime directives is: &quot;Show me the revenues!&quot; In the case of Canopy Growth stock there's no shortage in that department, as the company's recently reported fourth-quarter (ending March 31) net revenues rose to $71.37 million from $20.14 million a year earlier.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Of course, it could be argued that Canopy's blockbuster revenue growth was driven by Canada's legalization of recreational cannabis -- and I won't dispute that this was a contributing factor. Nonetheless, a more-than-threefold increase in revenues in the span of a year isn't just the result of decriminalization: Canopy made a boatload of money during the past year, outpacing its competitors and vindicating Constellation's outsized investment. Several Steps AheadWith the cannabis market moving forward at a breakneck pace, companies must now innovate just to remain competitive. Much like Constellation demonstrated its forward-thinking mind-set by investing in Canopy, there's clear evidence that Canopy is also taking the necessary steps to maintain their bellwether position among weed firms.For instance, when the company acquired medicinal marijuana producers in South America and Africa last year, CGC showed its dedication to expansion far beyond the North American borders. Moreover, when Canopy made the commitment in April of this year to acquire American cannabis company Acreage Holdings Inc. for $3.4 billion (under the condition that the U.S. legalizes production and sale of cannabis), Canopy Growth proved to its shareholders that it's ready, willing and able to stake its claim on American soil.I tend to concur with Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett when he opines that Canopy Growth's purchase of the right to acquire Acreage is a &quot;big positive&quot; for the company. As I see it, Canopy is being highly proactive by not waiting for a federal ruling on marijuana law; the company's preparing for American domination, come what may. The Bottom Line on CGC StockPersonally, I'm not overly concerned about how expensive the CGC stock price is today, tomorrow or next week. I'm focusing more on the fundamentals than anything else -- and given the company's deep capital reserves and forward-thinking mind-set, I like Canopy stock for a long-term allocation at practically any price.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1294,0.4411,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. shares dipped in Tuesday’s trading after reports circulated that a flaw in the Zoom app on Apple Inc. Macs could allow websites to take over user’s webcams.The vulnerability allows any website to “forcibly join a user to a Zoom call” without their permission, a Medium report found. The flaw could expose up to 750,000 companies around the world that use Zoom for daily business, the Medium post continued.Shares of the San Jose, California-based company dipped as much as 1.1%, touching $89.75 a share before erasing some of those losses.

Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.34%.In the options pits, put volume sank like a stone yesterday despite the market pullback. This suggests fear is being kept at bay and the selling we're seeing is garden variety profit-taking. By day's end, 16.7 million calls and just 12.3 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe summer doldrums continue to produce lackluster readings in the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio. It inched higher to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average climbed to 0.62. With both measures in the center of their three-month range, it leaves little to discuss regarding fear or complacency.Options trading ballooned in the following three stocks. AT&T (NYSE:T) was flooded with activity ahead of today's dividend payment. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slipped after being downgraded on poor iPhone sales. Finally, United States Steel (NYSE:X) suffered a high-volume drop that broke major support.Let's take a closer look: AT&T (T)Dividend plays took the top three spots of the leaderboard, but I've chosen to focus on AT&T because of its compelling price chart. The telecom titan has put together quite the one-month rally. The 8% jump has T stock now testing a key resistance zone at $34.30.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half With its ceiling looming large and overbought readings flashing, I suggest caution at chasing the shares here. A pullback or pause will provide lower-risk entries. Remember, AT&T is a stodgy dividend payer, not some high-flying tech stock prone to ignore overstretched readings.The real reason for AT&T's explosion in options trading is today's ex-dividend date. For holders of record, a 51 cent cash payment will be doled out. Institutions used calls to control the stock for long enough to capture the dividend. Based on its closing price of $34.25, the quarterly dividend payments result in an annual yield of 5.96%.Implied volatility remains at the low end of its one-year range -- the 20th percentile. So, if you're inclined to play options here, buying them is the way to go. Apple (AAPL)Apple shares suffered a setback Monday, falling as much as 2.8% during the trading session. The cause for the sudden slip was a downgrade by Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang from Neutral to Sell. Zhang pointed toward worse-than-expected new iPhone sales and a slowdown period for Apple's business as reasons for his bearishness.From a technical analysis view, the price drop did little to change the uptrend that has defined AAPL stock since early June. It remains above a rising 20-day moving average, and buyers emerged to defend their turf yesterday. Watch the $195 support zone moving forward. A breach of that would reverse the uptrend sending warning signs to chart followers everywhere.On the options trading front, the downgrade and accompanying down gap lit a fire under put demand. Total activity swelled to 139% of the average daily volume, with 532,795 contracts traded. Puts claimed 54% of the session's sum.  * 7 Simple Ways for Young Investors to Invest Their First $1,000 Implied volatility popped to 29% placing it at the 35th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $3.67 or 1.8%. United States Steel (X)United States Steel shares officially ended their recovery attempt on Monday. The one-day, 7.9% beatdown slammed X stock back below its 50-day and 20-day moving averages and signaled the beginning of its next descent. If the history of its trend is any indication, a revisit of last month's lows ($11.67) is a strong possibility.Volume surged alongside the descent creating an ominous-looking distribution day. Both its short-term ascending trendline and horizontal support from a prior pivot were breached, adding urgency to the decline. Until the stock can return to the north side of its 50-day moving average, steer clear of bullish trades.On the options trading front, surprisingly calls outpaced puts on the session. Total activity ramped to 152% of the average daily volume, with 78,654 contracts changing hands. Calls accounted for 53% of the tally.Implied volatility shot through the roof to end at 63%. That places it at the 74th percentile of its one-year range, suggesting that premiums are ripe for the selling.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1309,0.9954,"For investors in Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, it hasn't been a great summer so far. All around, stocks are hitting new record highs. The S&P 500 index came within a few points of reaching 3,000 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has been roaring. Software and internet stocks are absolutely booming at the moment. But SQ stock is doing nothing much at all.Source: Via SquareSince its peak at $101 last fall, SQ stock has been in a deep slump. By December, it had lost half its value, retreating to $50 a share. Square stock bounced back this spring, hitting $80 again in March. Since then, SQ stock has gone sideways to down, however, even as the market has taken off like a firecracker. At the current $73-and-change price, Square stock remains more than 25% below its record highs.It's not hard to see why investors are nervous. Competition looms large for Square. The company is still unprofitable on a trailing earnings basis. And it appears to be running out of strong domestic opportunities; bulls are already pointing to markets like Japan as Square's salvation. But if it can't make much money at home, will it do better overseas? Meanwhile rivals spanning from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to new things such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra coin could upend Square's plans.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Libra a Threat to Square?Last month, FB announced its long-awaited crypto-currency venture. Called the Libra, Facebook has grand ambitions for its entry into the crypto space.The Libra will be backed by hard assets with the aim of being a relatively stable store of value that users can transact with, globally, avoiding much of the world's current regulations and roadblocks to the free flow of money. Interesting, the Libra has a huge group of launching backers - several dozen in fact. These include almost all the power players in the payments space. The credit card companies are in, as is PayPal, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Stripe, and several payments companies in emerging markets.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Who is missing from the Libra launching coalition? Along with the big banks, Square isn't there. That's particularly interesting since other direct competitors to Square -- like Stripe -- are happy to be involved. Should SQ stock owners be worried?On the one hand, Libra, at least as it is now envisioned, isn't a big threat to Square's primary small business transaction processing at this point. Libra's big play, at least for now, appears to be taking on the entrenched fee-heavy money transfer and remittances services, like Western Union (NYSE:WU) and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI).So Square's main business isn't too directly threatened (yet).However, do note that Libra would compete more heavily with Square's Cash App. Also, it's worth considering that PayPal, which owns Venmo, is involved in Libra. PayPal certainly doesn't want the Libra to supplant Venmo. But as a backer of Libra, PayPal has way-more influence in how things go, while Square -- and its Cash App -- are on the outside looking in. Cash App may not Matter Much to SQ StockInterestingly, it may not be a big deal even if the Libra supplants much of Cash App's business. That's because Square likely generates very little revenue from Cash App as it is.Our Vince Martin broke down the numbers in a recent article. Given that PayPal's Venmo is a $300 million a year business, that means Square's necessarily is even smaller, since Venmo has more users and activity than Cash App. Though, in defense of Square, Cash App appears to be catching up based on download figures.Regardless, Square has a $30 billion market cap and $3.5 billion in annual revenues. Cash App is still something close to a rounding error for the overall business. It appears, at this point, to serve more as marketing for the Square platform than as a profit driver in its own right. So if much of Venmo and Cash App business gets diverted to Libra, it may not be a big issue for SQ stock. Can the Core Business Make Money?Unfortunately, this highlights the bigger issue for SQ stock. Despite penetrating a large portion of the small business market in the U.S., Square continues to lose money. At some point, you have to ask: When will this company be able to make money? Over the past 12 months, Square lost more than $50 million on its revenue of $3.5 billion.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 With U.S. growth already reaching limits, Square is now looking to overseas markets such as England for further opportunities. Perhaps most interestingly, some bulls see Japan as the next big thing for Square. Josh Enomoto highlighted the potential there, noting that Japanese consumers still love physical cash, in part because small stores don't like accepting credit cards. Enomoto wrote:Installing Square's payment-processing equipment isn't difficult. It also gives small Japanese businesses a more equal playing field against their larger counterparts. If more proprietors bought into this concept, it can create a ripple effect that ultimately skyrockets SQ stock.If the business model hasn't reached meaningful profitability in the U.S. yet, however, will going overseas improve matters? There will surely be more overhead, marketing costs, and so on to set up in new markets. And unfamiliarity with local customs will likely lead to some losses and setbacks as well. Bottom Line on SQ StockSQ stock is now trading at 65.6x forward earnings, as it faces too much competition and offers too little certainty. That's if they manage to hit analyst estimates. As it is, the company has no &quot;E&quot; in the P/E ratio at the moment since it lost money last year.It's not clear how the company plans to monetize the Cash App, many bulls' current big hope for the future. And international expansion could lead to more headaches down the road. Facebook's Libra, if it is a hit with consumers, could cause trouble for Square on multiple fronts as well. Square stock has an interesting story. But at nearly 10x sales and a massive forward P/E ratio, Square stock investors are paying a high price for an uncertain future.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned FB stock.

1310,0.9493,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has become a tech stock that no longer trades like a tech stock. The shares jumped almost 50% in mid-April after the chip maker won a settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), then QCOM stock lost half that gain after Judge Lucy Koh ruled it was violating antitrust laws.Source: Qualcomm Instead, it trades like a defendant.Since the start of June it has been slowly climbing a wall of worry over the impact of Koh's decision. Fundamentals -- expectations it will earn 62 cents per share on revenue of $5.11 billion when it next reports earnings July 31 -- don't seem to matter anymore.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Do Fundamentals Matter?Qualcomm opened for trade July 8 at about $76.30 per share. That's a market cap of $93 billion. It trades at about 4.2 times last year's $22 billion in revenue and 40.5x last year's earnings, with a fat 62 cents per share dividend reflecting a 3.2% yield.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice That dividend is an investor hedge against legal uncertainties that have plagued the company as CEO Steve Mollenkopf has defended Qualcomm's business model against challengers from around the world.He's had a good track record. Qualcomm has won favorable decisions in Korean, Chinese and U.S. courts. The Apple settlement seemed to settle its right to tie patents to chip purchases. But the decision that it must renegotiate those patent licenses , which the court ruled over the July 4 holiday won't be delayed, has it claiming it is about to suffer &quot;irreparable harm&quot; after it earlier sided with the Federal Trade Commission's view that Qualcomm abused its dominant market position to force customers to pay excessive patent licensing fees.European competition commissioner Margarethe Vestager is also planning on demanding another huge fine against Qualcomm over its policies. What About 5G?Meanwhile 5G, the new mobile standard that is in the process of being rolled out to phones, base stations, and machines around the world, opening vast new swaths of frequency spectrum to commercialization, is practically being ignored.Qualcomm has been quietly going about the business of having its chips certified, and winning the right to charge users for bits used in autonomous cars.The car decision emphasizes that the growth of 5G won't just come from people watching cat videos. It will come from machines communicating with &quot;smart city&quot; infrastructure that can prevent traffic jams and schedule maintenance in utility systems and factories.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 New markets like augmented reality and virtual reality also depend on having practically unlimited bandwidth. This has led analysts to bring back their hockey stick graphs predicting tremendous growth. Qualcomm's new legal battlefield involves working with phone companies to make sure people pay for that bandwidth, assuring that the bulk of growth comes from licensed rather than unlicensed frequencies.In the near term, however, 5G is also subject to tremendous amounts of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Industry hype is pushing users to upgrade even before the necessary infrastructure is in place, with many people thinking they have it even when they don't. Bottom Line on Qualcomm StockFortunately for Qualcomm stock owners, the company is better positioned than any of its customers to win the 5G jackpot.But that jackpot is so large, and Qualcomm has been so aggressive in its licensing policies, that there's legitimate fear the company may be forced by courts and regulators to back off.QCOM stock investors may be both overestimating how well the company's lawyers can do, but underestimating just how much money can be saved, and earned, in a world of wireless sensors and networks that control, and maintain, all the things around us.The 5G revolution won't happen all at once. Qualcomm won't win as much control over it as it's seeking. But it's going to be big enough to justify a long-term investor seeking an entry point in Qualcomm stock after any legal setback.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

1314,0.5437,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Gold has had some reputational issues since reaching a record high in 2011. The thesis at the time was that a massive expansion of the money supply via the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program would spark hyper-inflation, making hard assets more attractive than financial assets. Hyper-inflation never came to pass, which helps to explain why the price of gold tumbled almost 50% over the following four years.We still don’t have very much inflation, and yet there is renewed interest in gold with prices reaching their highest since early 2013 at about $1,440 an ounce. There are a lot of reasons to like gold. One is that gold tracks fairly closely with budget deficits. The highs of 2009-2011 roughly corresponded with the large deficits that reached 10% of GDP during the Obama administration, which included the stimulus spending during the Great Recession and a sharp depreciation in the value of the dollar.This time there is a sense that the deficit problem is large and intractable. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the deficit will more than double to 8.7% of GDP by 2049. Also, there is open discussion of things such as modern monetary theory, or MMT, which would be about the most gold-bullish development imaginable.Gold is the closest thing that we have to an objective store of value. Many disagree, saying there is nothing objective to gold’s value, since it generates no cash flows. That’s not the point. The point is that there is a finite amount of gold in the earth’s crust, there is growing evidence that we have mined most of it, and aside from traveling to an asteroid, we aren’t going to produce much more. (Full disclosure: I have positions that would profit from rally in gold and the shares of gold mining companies.)The cryptocurrency promoters argue that Bitcoin is an objective store of value, and they are somewhat right, since there can only be a certain number of coins in existence. But Bitcoin has some technical complications that gold does not, such as what happens if the power goes out? I have argued for years that tangible things you can pick up and touch are considerably more valued than lines of computer code. Time will tell.But the biggest factor affecting gold prices recently has been the proliferation of negative-yielding debt. There are about $13 trillion of negative-yielding bonds in the world, and a shiny rock that yields nothing – but, admittedly, has some storage costs - is actually high-yielding in comparison.Those who advocate the investment merits of gold are often labeled as “gold bugs,” which has become a somewhat derisive phrase, associated with conspiracy theories and tinfoil hats. But in the current political and economic environment, there are real intellectual reasons to think about gold other than hysteria over hyper-inflation due to money printing.The hysteria over inflation due to money supply growth was pretty widely accepted in 2009, including by me, but it was the fear of inflation that drove people into gold, which worked out, and put options on 30-year bonds, which didn’t. In other words, gold can move on fear. It can move on fear of deficits and it can move on fear of MMT -- even if those fears are never realized. Markets are occasionally irrational, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to profit from the irrationality.Every bubble has two phases. There’s the first move, which is backed by lots of speculative froth and retail participation, and the second move, which is the real move and that may not happen until years later. It happened with tech, first in 1999, which eventually involved into the FAANG group of stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google. It seems to be happening in Bitcoin, as the most recent thrust higher is mostly happening without retail participation. And it is happening in gold, where a dearth of retail coin sales suggests the surge higher is more about institutional and central bank demand.People tend to invest in what they have an affinity for and what they agree with. Environmentalists and animal rights folks invested in Beyond Meat.  Cannabis “enthusiasts” invested in cannabis stocks. Conservatives like gold.

1322,0.9593,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Resurgent tensions between Japan and South Korea threaten to wallop chipmakers from Samsung Electronics Co. to SK Hynix Inc., upsetting a carefully choreographed global supply chain by smothering the production of memory chips and other components vital to widely used devices.As the world fixates on Donald Trump’s campaign to contain Huawei Technologies Co. and China’s ambitions, a concurrent dispute between Beijing’s two richest neighbors also has far-reaching implications for the production of everything from Apple Inc. iPhones to Dell Technologies Inc. laptops. The industry is now scrambling to gauge the fallout after Japan -- citing longstanding and unresolved tensions -- slapped restrictions on exports to Korea of three classes of materials crucial to the production of semiconductors and cutting-edge screens.That maneuver, the most recent manifestation of decades of war-time tensions, places Samsung at the center of a firestorm and again underscores the global nature of the production machine that cranks out most of the world’s gadgets. Not only does it make memory chips, but Samsung is also the biggest producer of smartphones.Korea’s largest company has lost about 16 trillion won ($13 billion) in market value this month through Monday, while Hynix has shed 1.5 trillion won. The two companies -- which together account for 60% of the world’s memory chip-making capacity -- declined to comment.While inventory levels differ across each material, Samsung has under a month’s worth of supply on average, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung and SK Hynix are busily sourcing alternatives, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a sensitive political issue. The two Korean giants assured clients they would try to minimize the impact on output, but Samsung, for one, is bracing for potential production cuts or even stoppages should the situation persist, the people said.That’s why the Korean conglomerate’s de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, hopped on a jet to Tokyo over the weekend for emergency meetings with Japanese suppliers. It’s unclear how deeply felt the impact might be -- much depends on whether Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-In can work out a compromise. But in a worst-case scenario, flexible screens for iPhones and other mobile devices could sputter, while memory chips used in everything from HP Inc. notebooks to Amazon.com Inc. servers could dwindle.“This is an unprecedented event,” said Jongjun Won, chief executive officer at Lime Asset Management Co. “If it’s lucky, the chip industry may be able to adjust inventories. There could be a happy ending if the Japan issue gets resolved in the meantime. However, the intertwining of politics and business is making it difficult to find a solution.”The dispute has spilled over into social media. South Koreans, angered by Japan’s move, have taken to Instagram and other platforms to call for boycotts of Japanese travel and consumer products.Japan’s targeting a trio of materials that, while little-known outside of the industry, is profoundly important for electronics production. The government says they also have sensitive military applications. Within the tech sector, fluorinated polyimide is required for the production of foldable panels -- such as those used in Samsung’s Galaxy Fold -- among other things. Photo-resists are key to chipmaking, while hydrogen fluoride is needed for both chip and display production.Finding substitutes won’t be easy: Korean corporations now depend on Japan for over 90% of all the fluorinated polyimide and resists it needs, and 44% of its hydrogen fluoride requirements, Societe Generale estimates. Ironically, if the dispute drags on, Japanese suppliers of those chemicals -- companies from JSR Corp. to Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. that comprise a small but inextricable link in the chain -- could take a hit as well.“This could be a negative factor for the world economy,” Huh Nam-Kwon, CEO at Shinyoung Asset Management Co, said by phone. “All we need to do is wait and see how the situation goes. Just one word from Abe could decide anything. It’s hard to predict.”The most significant impact will be on Samsung’s next-generation products: foldable displays as well as chips of 7 nanometer line-widths or less that’re made via the so-called extreme ultra-violet (EUV) process. That puts at risk Samsung’s express goal of investing $116 billion to become the No.1 in the logic chip business by 2030. Without Japan’s materials, Samsung may be hamstrung in efforts to develop an EUV-based foundry business and in advanced memory chipmaking.Their rivals may step in to fill that gap in the interim. Micron Technology Inc., the only other memory chip maker of significance, stands to benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could further widen its lead over Samsung when it comes to made-to-order chips, vying for Samsung customers like Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp.“There will be considerable impact on both sides,” said Heungchong Kim, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. “Those materials are not something that can be replaced in a short period. This is becoming a weird situation.”The situation may worsen if Japan removes South Korea from a so-called “White List” of countries treated as presenting no risk of weapons proliferation, a move Tokyo is now considering.Japan and Korea have traditionally turned to the U.S. to mediate in their clashes, but it’s unclear this time if Trump is keen to step into the fray. Compounding the situation are the basic mechanics of the restrictions. While not a ban per se, would-be exporters of the affected materials need to obtain a license from the government. That could take up to 90 days -- an eternity for a fast-moving industry.There’s also disagreement by industry analysts over which corporations exactly will get hit hardest, in part because some Japanese firms have either localized production in South Korea or maintain plants in countries such as China.“In the near-term, we do not expect Korean companies’ major customers to move to other component vendors due to high switching costs and long qualification process times,” said J.J. Park, head of Korean equity research at JP Morgan. But “if there is a bottleneck due to a shortage of key materials resulting from Japan’s curb on export of materials, we can’t rule out potential market-share loss to their peers.”Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co. is a key supplier of polyimides, according to Taipei-based WitsView and Isaiah Research -- but company representatives deny it makes the material. IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh said in addition to Sumitomo Chemical, SKC -- like Hynix, an affiliate of the giant SK Group -- or Kolon Industries are viable local substitutes.JSR is a major resist producer, while the global hydrogen fluoride market is dominated by Kanto Denka Kogyo Co., Showa Denko KK and Daikin Industries Ltd., according to Taipei-based Isaiah Research. Resist manufacturer Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co. said it already supplies South Korean customers locally. Daikin said the restrictions will have no impact on its hydrogen fluoride because the materials are made in China, while Morita Chemical Industries Co. is building a plant there that will go online next year.“While high levels of semiconductor inventory might provide some cushion, time may not be on Korea’s side,” Citigroup economists Jin-Wook Kim and Johanna Chua said in a recent note. “Displacing Korean chips would disrupt the supply chain because building alternative sources needs specific technology and sizable capex.”(Updates with analyst’s comments from the 18th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Heejin Kim, Yuki Furukawa and Isabel Reynolds.To contact the reporters on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.065,0.862,0.073,1

Investors were a little on edge with the Nasdaq today, with a notable downgrade on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), weakness in many semiconductor stocks and investors' worries about whether the Federal Reserve will actually cut interest rates now. As a result, the Nasdaq slipped 78 basis points, closing near the key 8,100 level at 8,098. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore Friday's better-than-expected labor report, the market had been pricing in as much as a 50-basis-point cut in the Fed Funds rates. Consensus expectations still call for a 25 bps cut.   In any regard, all but removing the hopes for a 50 bps cut -- there's still a ~6% chance this month -- is denting equities. Worth mentioning though is that the market is 100% pricing in some form of a cut. We detailed why this is important for tech stock specifically on Friday. We won't rehash that conversation. However, we will just say that, should the Fed opt to not cut rates -- and remember, this is the same Fed that was way too hawkish in Q4 2018 -- stock market investors will throw a tantrum.  Google-Dish to Battle the New &quot;Big Three?&quot;Typically used in reference of Detroit's three largest automakers, the &quot;Big Three&quot; of telecom very well could become AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), assuming the latter is able to close on its acquisition of Sprint (NYSE:S).   * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 However, part of getting the T-Mobile/Sprint deal approved requires divesting enough assets for a fourth large carrier to emerge. Short of working out a few of the details, it seems that Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) will be the emerging player.  Rumors that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is considering teaming up with Dish were quickly squashed by the company. But it brings up an interesting point. Surely investors will boo GOOGL getting involved in a capital-intensive business like telecom, no matter how strong its balance sheet is or how much free-cash flow such a business generates. Capital-intensive businesses generally come with a high valuation and dividend yield (which makes the Big Three of telecom and auto more similar than just the nickname). Want more? Rumors say former Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Alan Mulally is negotiating for Google in these alleged talks. Speculation and potential coincidences aside, I don't know that I believe GOOGL is considering such a move. That's even with its Android operating system and its line of Pixel smartphones. But it wouldn't be the worst way to pump life into its handset/smartphone business, even if it is capital intensive. In any regard, shareholders would have a fit and the c-suite knows it.  Tesla TodayTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) made headlines -- when is that not the case? -- when its CEO Elon Musk opened up further about the automaker's self-driving car plans. One Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user asked, &quot;Do consumers have limited time left to buy a Tesla car since prices would have to go up severalfold to balance supply & demand once you solve FSD?&quot;Musk's answer: Yes. Of course, the next question then turns to solving FSD (full self-driving). Level 5 autonomous driving is no easy feat, and it's hard to imagine that it will come into play to the point where consumers have to worry about how much time they have left to buy a Tesla vehicle near today's prices. Musk also said the company is working on launching new self-driving chips for older Teslas by the end of the year.   Last but not least regarding Tesla, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas stuck with his full-year vehicle deliveries forecast of 347,000. That's below the company's estimate of 360,000 to 400,000 and despite its second-quarter results of 95,200 came in ahead of consensus. Jonas also lowered his revenue estimates for Q3 and Q4, while maintaining a $230 price target and an equal-weight rating.  Other News in the Nasdaq TodayApple was also in the analyst spotlight Monday, catching a downgrade to &quot;sell&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; at Rosenblatt Securities. The analyst has a $150 price target, implying about 25% downside. He believes that iPhone and iPad revenue will be disappointing in the second half. Apple fell 2.06% on the day.Finally, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is apparently making progress on its deal for Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). The company is also apparently considering a purchase of the privately held Tibco, but the deal will be &quot;sidelined&quot; if the SYMC deal moves forward. That seems to be the case on Monday, with AVGO reportedly making progress on securing the financing for the deal. An announcement could come later this month. In any regard, investors still aren't happy about the news, pushing AVGO down 2.72% to roughly $275 on the day.

(VZ)Verizon (NYSE:VZ), usually a defensive name, was somewhat offensive today, losing 0.70% after Citigroup lowered its rating to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy,&quot; citing risks in the broader telecommunications space.&quot;The opportunities for further multiple expansion have narrowed, in our view, as we close in on different wireless merger scenarios from what we previously envisioned and Verizon is less likely to pursue bolder strategic moves to accelerate its network and 5G strategies over the next 6-12 months,&quot; said Citi analyst Michael Rollins in a note. Looking For Good News?Investors looking for positive vibes on a day when those were hard to come by can focus on at least two Dow stocks. Let's start with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare component in the Dow. Shares of the beleaguered health insurance provider could be second-half winners.&quot;That's at least according to technical analyst Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors. With UnitedHealth shares down nearly 14% from their 52-week highs made in December, Newton said Friday that this Dow dud is poised for a breakout,&quot; reports CNBC.A cyclical name to consider may just be Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), shares of which are up just 7.35% this year.&quot;Caterpillar has created a virtuous cycle by manufacturing superior quality equipment that has fostered a premium product reputation,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;The equipment therefore is highly fungible with known resale values. It also has a robust support infrastructure, which creates a lucrative aftermarket business.&quot; Bottom LineWith it appearing increasingly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this month or perhaps even this quarter, investors will likely be beholden to company-specific events over the near-term. That will be even more true as second-quarter earnings reports start trickling in over the coming days.This week, however, hope burns eternal for encouraging news on the rate cut front.&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony on monetary policy before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, which some investors expect will provide clues regarding the likelihood of a rate cut from the U.S. central bank when it meets at the end of the month,&quot; reports Reuters.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

1334,0.8074,"U.S. stock-market indexes fell for a second straight session on Monday as investors continued to rethink expectations for a deep rate cut by the Federal Reserve following the conclusion of its policy gathering at the end of this month. A better-than-expected employment report, with some 224,000 jobs created in June, has raised doubts that the central bank, run by Jerome Powell, will take aggressive action to avert the perception of weakness in the U.S. economy. Investors have been betting that easier monetary policy can help equity indexes drift toward fresh highs like those rung up last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  finished down 116 points, or 0.4%, at 26,806, the S&P 500 index  fell 14 points, or 0.5%, at 2,976, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  declined 0.8% to reach 8,098. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday, and Wall Street will watch for clues on how the central banker will conduct monetary policy.

Also weighing on sentiment is a downgrade of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by analysts at Rosenblatt. The downgrade comes ahead of the company's unveiling of its new iPhone handsets later this year. And it also comes despite the addition of the stock to Needham's conviction buy list. The downgrade is apparently carrying more influence on the minds of traders.With all eyes on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, stocks look set for further weakness here as an acceleration of job gains reported on Friday makes the rate cuts that the future market is expecting less and less likely.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The potential for disappointment is high at a time when a number of important large-cap stocks are already rolling over. Here are four Dow Jones stocks to sell now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks to Sell: Apple (AAPL)Apple shares are testing below the $200-a-share level and risks a violation of the 50-day moving average as investors respond to the downgrade from analysts at Rosenblatt, who assigned a $150 price target on a &quot;fundamental deterioration&quot; over the next 6-12 months.To be fair, this price target is the lowest among the 39 Wall Street analysts covering the stock. But following the departure of Apple's longtime design guru, doubts are growing.The company will next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.10 per share on revenues of $53.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $2.46 per share beat estimates by 10 cents on a 5.1% decline in revenues. Boeing (BA)Boeing's (NYSE:BA) woes continue to grow, with the 737 MAX fleet still grounded and a Federal probe into its safety practices widening to the 787 Dreamliner as well. Today, a Saudi airline cancelled nearly a $6 billion order for 737 MAXs in favor of Airbus. The longer the grounding continues, the more damage is done to the company's hard-won reputation with passengers.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.81 per share on revenues of $19.9 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $3.16 per share missed estimates by three cents on a 2% decline in revenues. General Electric (GE)Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) are rolling down off of overhead resistance going back to late February, setting up a violation of both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Watch for a return to the April low near $9, which would be worth a loss of more than 12% from here.JPMorgan analysts recently reiterated a cautious view of the company's power business.The company will next report results on July 31 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 12 cents per share on revenues of $28.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of 14 cents per share beat estimates by five cents on a 1.8% decline in revenues. Intel (INTC)Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are struggling to rise up and over their 200-day moving average, risking a reversal back down to its late-May lows. Shareholders are still shell-shocked by the near-30% decline suffered from the high set in April as semiconductor sales slowed and manufacturing activity globally hit a wall. There are also worries that the U.S.-China trade fight will be centered on the semiconductor industry. The U.S. government, for instance, pushed to cut Huawei off from American suppliers.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice The company will next report results on July 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 90 cents per share on revenues of $15.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of 89 cents per share beat estimates by two cents on more than $16 billion in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1344,-0.9884,"There used to be a time when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was merely interested in dominating social media. Even though this was just a few years ago, it almost seems like a different era altogether. Today, Facebook stock is almost unrecognizable from when it first launched as a publicly traded company.Source: Shutterstock Naturally, many folks view this as a negative. While respecting the tremendous run up in the Facebook stock price, bears reference the law of large numbers. At a certain point, a growth name simply becomes too big. Impressing from this elevated position requires a perhaps impossible revenue tally. Bad News Follows FB StockWe already saw how this dynamic could negatively and dramatically impact FB stock. Shortly after shares hit record highs, they quickly collapsed. The reason? A poor showing in the social media giant's second-quarter earnings report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I argued at the time, the numbers themselves weren't bad. For instance, analysts pegged the consensus target for Q2 revenue at $13.36 billion. FB delivered $13.23 billion, which is within 1% of hitting the forecast square on. Additionally, the company &quot;only&quot; brought in $9.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.What other investment besides Facebook stock experiences a hemorrhaging following a 43%-plus sales lift? I'd say the list is extremely short, perhaps exclusive.Moreover, FB stock trades under the specter of increasing regulation. It's a matter that also clouds organizations like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Having gained immense power and influence, federal regulators are worried that too much of these attributes are concentrated in the hands of an elite few.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Regulation isn't an inconsequential issue as most Americans are concerned about their online privacy. For instance, a Pew study revealed that 91% of Americans either agree or strongly agree that that people have lost control over their digital footprint. Additionally, half of our fellow citizens do not trust the federal government or social media sites to protect their data.That's quite an indictment, and unfortunately, this discourse eventually centers on FB stock. After all, the media plastered Facebook's name across multiple controversies. First came the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, which implied that the company inadvertently helped President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Then came accusations that Facebook allowed partner companies to read their users' private messages.It all sounds terrible. However, it's unlikely that any of these controversies will derail Facebook stock. Investors Must Read Between the LinesI'm not making that statement lightly. I don't personally know Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg nor any of the company's high-profile executives. But it's safe to say that they probably yawn every time politicians have leveled harsh criticisms toward their monopolistic business.However, they won't yawn if the federal government actually backed up the rhetoric with meaningful action. While we really haven't seen many instances where Uncle Sam forced giant conglomerates to break up, it's not without precedent.And a coerced break-up is one aspect of this regulatory cloud that surely keeps Zuckerberg up at night. This is the young man who once turned down $1 billion from Yahoo. Personally, I wouldn't have the conviction to do such a thing at any age. Give me half that and I'll be on my merry way!Thus, you can expect Zuckerberg to fight tooth and nail regarding any attempt to dissolve Facebook. Taking unfathomable risks to grow the company to where it is now, he's not in a position to back down.But that's not the primary reason why I'm bullish on FB stock remaining as it is. Currently, we're living in a dangerous time from a geopolitical standpoint. With the rapid rise of China, and an increasingly belligerent Russia, our status as the global alpha dog is not assured.And contrary to President Trump's many rants -- on Facebook rival Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) platform -- we're not winning in many areas. A big source of anxiety is our declining presence in science and technology. If we cannot improve as a nation, we have several competitors that would love to take over.In that context, we must do everything we can to protect our core assets. The Feds going after our own companies and weakening them is not a part of that strategy. Facebook Stock Is a Monster We Must Deal WithRather than fight Facebook, and by logical deduction, Facebook stock, we should support this phenomenon if for no other reason than identity politics: FB, while a monster, is our monster.Here's what I mean. China has a cohesive strategy to leapfrog the U.S. in artificial intelligence by the year 2030. I want you to really think about the implications of the Chinese Communist Party taking point over one of the most critical components of the broader technology industry.Then, I want you to consider what Russian President Vladimir Putin had to say about AI. At a student conference two years ago, Putin declared:&quot;Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind … It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.&quot;Putin is many things, but stupid is not one of them. In fact, he like the Chinese have been developing plans to overtake U.S. technological and geopolitical hegemony for years.Fortunately for now, our adversaries are just dreaming. Decisively, we're leading in AI and other core technologies of tomorrow thanks to companies like Facebook, Intel (NASDAQ:FB) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), among several others.As I've argued for AT&T (NYSE:T), some companies are too important for our national security. For instance, I don't anticipate the government cracking down on AT&T any more than they have to. That's because the 5G network is a vital pathway for future innovations. Indeed, virtually all technologies, whether AI, cloud computing, automation or robotics will somehow involve 5G.Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for the feds to stymie AT&T. I have the same argument for FB stock. FB Owns a Critical MoatWhile federal regulators are eyeballing Facebook stock and its ilk, I can guarantee you something right now: they're much more worried about what the Chinese and Russians are cooking up in their labs.I think this is a great reminder, especially for younger investors, that we're not all the same. Every time I travel abroad, I am always grateful to fly back to American soil. Naturally, you don't truly appreciate what you have until you lose it.Suffering an online privacy violation is no small matter. But it's far worse to arbitrarily lose your human rights, or to suffer political (or even physical) assassination. These are incidences that happen frequently in China and Russia, despite what their bought-and-paid-for trolls have to say.I bring this up because the government must address the most pressing threat. For all his faults and idiosyncrasies, Zuckerberg does not represent an existential threat to our rights and freedoms. But we can lose these things if we fall to second place regarding critical technologies.And this is why I believe the regulatory noise that we're hearing is still hot air. At the end of the day, we need FB.Before anyone can integrate artificial intelligence, they must first have a sizable pool of natural intelligence. Since AI mimics human intelligence, not having access to the latter component is a deal-breaker.And this is why Facebook stock is such a vital investment. No one, not Twitter, not Snap (NYSE:SNAP), not even China's WeChat has Facebook's clout and extensive reach. This goldmine of human intelligence that can catalyze an unprecedented AI platform exists right here in America.When we're falling behind in so many other areas, Facebook is our vital lifeline. Threatening it with a breakup is counterproductive to our national interests. Only Facebook Can Develop a Comprehensive AI SolutionOne of the key selling points for Facebook stock in terms of AI is diversity. Admittedly, out of all the social media sites globally, WeChat poses the most competent challenge to FB. Levering over one billion users, WeChat and Facebook are the only two social media companies to cross that threshold.But if WeChat were to compete with FB on AI solutions, it would have a major problem: a lack of diversity. For instance, most of WeChat's users are Chinese. You can surmise that from the company's penetration rate in China, which stands at nearly 86%.On the other hand, Facebook has broader coverage. Its penetration rate in the U.S. is 72.4%, which suggests further growth opportunities in the native market. More importantly, FB has double-digit penetration rates in every region of the world.Why does this matter? If you're going to lead in AI, you can't just mimic one segment of the world population. After all, human intelligence is such a rich and even controversial issue. How one societal group thinks and reacts could be completely different to another.Here, Facebook, and by logical deduction FB stock present obvious advantages. With a two billion-plus user base, simple math tells you that a majority of Facebook's active users aren't American. That means the company isn't just sitting on a domestic data gold mine, but an international one.Of course, this diverse pool offers compelling geopolitical advantages. But thinking down to the commercial level, FB has a clear leg up. Through their extensive data, the social media firm can better pinpoint what sells in different countries, and what doesn't.That's the power of having a globally recognized and respected brand. Therefore, I doubt that the one entity to take down this lucrative Goliath is our own government. FB Has a Unique Role in Fighting Fake NewsBy now, we've all heard the term &quot;fake news&quot; uttered so much that it may have lost its original &quot;oomph.&quot; As President Trump seemingly defines it, fake news is anything with which you don't agree.But while the concept may be a punchline here, it's serious business abroad. For example, Chinese trolls are always on the prowl, doing Beijing's bidding online. And we're not just talking about inundating public forums with false information, though that certainly exists. Rather, trolls have taken on a more direct and disruptive approach.For instance, CNN reported a story in April about a coordinated attack on a Facebook site supporting China's Uyghur population. The Uyghur people are a largely Muslim group and are located in China's far-western region of Xinjiang. However, they clash with the dominant Han Chinese group.Subsequently, Chinese authorities routinely violate the Uyghur people's human rights with impunity. Several grassroots sites exist to bring awareness to this relatively little-known crisis. Naturally, Beijing wants to keep the turmoil under wraps, deploying trolls to control the narrative.When it comes to combating fake news and misinformation, Facebook has been caught on the wrong side of the tracks. But they're making up for prior shortfalls with a more effective censoring protocol.I concede that such an approach isn't without controversy. Conservatives have argued that social media sites unfairly target them, and they may have a point. At the same time, Facebook has successfully eliminated several genuine bad actors.Over the long run, I expect them to bolster their anti-fake news platform. Not only does this improve the user experience, it mitigates Chinese and Russian digital attacks. As I've established, these adversarial nations present a far greater threat to our way of life than Facebook stock. China Doesn't Play by the Rules and Neither Should FBFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote a powerful op-ed for The New York Times. In it, Hughes described all the reasons why the government should break up FB stock. As someone who has worked at the social media giant from the get-go, his opinion has substantial weight.Nevertheless, I think he's dead wrong and painfully naive about the national security implications for Facebook stock. If the government forcibly breaks up the company, it would only please China and Russia to no end.How do I know this? Because they gleefully and mockingly admit their agenda. Indeed, Hughes wears the same rose-tinted glasses that many Americans do when discussing China. They view the nation merely as an eastern competitor. It's far deeper than that.China seeks to dominate the world, and they'll go through any means to attain this goal. Do you think that when Chinese President Xi Jinping referenced the &quot;long march&quot; during the recent trade war tensions, he was merely talking about the current state of affairs? No. Clearly, his eyes are focused on a much more comprehensive prize.Thus, if we lose the technological race, we cannot regain that position as easily as Hughes implied. Primarily, that's because we're a nation of laws. In contrast, China is a nation of lawlessness. I realize that sounds incredibly harsh. But again, the Chinese will do anything to win the tech race.Consider the Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) espionage case. Chinese agents blatantly stole intellectual property from Micron regarding proprietary memory-chip technology. The New York Times' description of the incident reads like a made-for-Hollywood script.Except that it's all too real. If we can't trust the Chinese to follow the rules -- and let me reiterate that we absolutely cannot trust them -- then we shouldn't hamstring our own companies to further disadvantage. American Virtue Becomes a Vice, or at Least a LiabilityHughes makes a strong point that the Founding Fathers resisted tyranny in the political space. Therefore, it makes zero sense that we would accept it in the economic realm.As further evidence, the markets respond well to free competition. Without breaking up the old AT&T, we may not enjoy the smart-device conveniences that we take for granted today.Fair enough. It's reasonable to believe that if the U.S. Constitution defends our freedoms, it should also defend free commerce. A monopoly like Facebook stifles competition and does not align with our sacred traditions.However, the Founding Fathers never addressed how to overcome an adversary that consistently breaks the rules. To have any semblance of an equitable platform, we too must ignore established protocol and mandates.Of course, that's not going to happen. We as Americans will stick to our virtues come hell or high water. But in dealing with an amoral entity, such absolutism is a liability.Admittedly, I don't think we have ready-made answers to address the China and Russia threats. But what I can tell you is that we cannot afford to punish our biggest and brightest tech firms. We live in an ugly world, competing with dirty players. Despite this, we can still hold to our values. However, we should give no favors to the opposition.Logically, this means letting FB off the hook for anti-competitive behaviors and privacy breaches. I get it. It doesn't sound right. Indeed, some folks might call it -- like Hughes does -- un-American.Sadly, I don't think we have a choice. When our opposition places zero premium on moral standards, we ourselves can't hold onto them too tightly. Trump Is Right on Two CountsOver the past two-and-a-half years, I've learned to tune out most of what President Trump has to say. In part, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what he thinks. And on another level, he sometimes comes off as that crazy uncle spewing conspiracy theories at the dinner table.But where I find myself agreeing with the President wholeheartedly is his stance on China. After looking at this issue from all angles, I've realized this: it's better to nip this in the bud as early as possible.Because what is the alternative here? Let the Chinese do whatever they please? Well, let's face it: they've been doing exactly that. As I just mentioned, they stole vital technology and information from Micron. And that's just one case out of many.By putting China on notice, Trump let them know that their dirty and illegal tactics won't work. Now, the Chinese must decide if their nearer-term economy can survive their longer-term ambitions.Second, Trump is also correct (in a way) to call out European regulators for fining American tech firms. True, the regulators are merely doing their job. However, I appreciate that Trump is at least sticking up for our tech industry. As problematic as the industry is, it's a key American asset.Hurting it only hurts our longer-term interests.This sentiment goes back to my point about FB and Facebook stock. We're not talking about a perfect situation, or even a pleasant one. Clearly, Zuckerberg and company have failed the American public on many counts.But we're also at a juncture where we need him -- and people like him -- the most. Killing that drive could be the most un-American thing of all. FB Stock Is Too Important to FailAs we discussed, federal regulators have every right to investigate Facebook for anti-competitive practices. If we lived in a world where China and Russia didn't exist, I'd say let the regulators have their way with FB stock.But we don't live in that world. Instead, as global leaders, we have a target on our back. However, the difference this time around is that our adversaries have a legitimate pathway to overtake us. I think I speak for every rational American that such a circumstance is completely unacceptable.Therefore, we've got to do everything we can to prevent this greater power from materializing. Answers won't come easy. But we certainly can't afford to stymie the creative impulses of our most dominant institutions.Doing so doesn't just hurt Facebook stock. It also gives an undeserved shortcut to our greatest adversaries.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock.

1353,0.9952,"With each day that goes by, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) becomes increasingly entrenched in our lives. Obviously, the prevalence of this social media platform boosts the case for TWTR stock. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) subscription news service Apple News+. It's a wrinkle that could negatively impact AAPL stock.Source: Shutterstock Just to recap, earlier this year, the consumer technology giant announced a mobile-app service which aggregates various news sources. The idea here was both simple yet brilliant: provide readers with access to hundreds of magazines and leading newspapers, all in one place. And if market enthusiasm is any indicator, Apple stock steadily gained - after a brief volatile phase -- following the announcement.It's no surprise that both Apple and the magazine/newspaper industry jumped on this symbiotic opportunity. For years, print publications have cratered, even in outlets such as grocery stores. Waiting in line at the checkout counter can sometimes be a frustrating experience. That's why grocers target this area for magazines and other publications.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's been a great revenue source until digitalization disrupted everything. However, traditional print-media companies are warming up to digital trends: if you can't beat them, join them. And this is the driving force behind Apple News+. Theoretically, it provides another revenue channel to further lift AAPL stock.Just as importantly, Apple News+ gives the tech firm a chance to do some disrupting of its own. As mentioned at the top, Twitter has penetrated the mainstream consciousness. Naturally, TWTR stock has moved higher after slugging through its doldrums.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 With elements like peak smartphone negatively impacting Apple stock, the underlying company could use another sales base. However, early indicators suggest that Apple News+ is no panacea. Apple News+ Not Getting the Job Done for AAPL StockAt first glance, Apple News+ sounds like a great deal. For only $10 a month, you get access to real journalism, not the &quot;fake news&quot; that sometimes infiltrates social media. Moreover, for those who really value the written word, the service is very comparable to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Already, this sounds like a winner, which could go a long way to supporting AAPL stock.Plus, Apple brings some goodies to the table. For example, under the marketed family-sharing plan, family members automatically gain access to News+ once you join. That ramps up the value-add for prospective buyers, which should lead to massive sales. Again, Apple stock appears to be sitting on a goldmine.Unfortunately, early reports suggest it's just that: appearances. According to Gizmodo.com contributor Adam Clark Estes, this news service is a &quot;total mess.&quot;First, Estes complained that not everything worked as advertised. The value-add for the family plan apparently didn't pan out. While a relatively small detail, nothing ticks off consumers more than marketing an attribute that doesn't work or exist. From a PR perspective, that's bad news for AAPL stock.Another sticking point for Estes is the interface process. In his opinion, utilizing the service is a clumsy affair and borderline unprofessional. Looking for specific articles is a time-consuming endeavor. Backstories only go back about a year, which almost contradicts the term. Some stories are formatted as PDF files, but without optimization for iPhone screens. And you don't get full access to a specific magazine or journal's digital portfolio.Some consumers might feel cheated from this soft bait-and-switch tactic. Logically, this does nothing to help the perception of AAPL stock. Twitter Provides a Clear Contrast to Apple StockOn the other hand, Twitter is not only a relevant news source and influential social media platform, but also a very financially healthy company. Given where key performance metrics are, it should have no problem continuing to outperform the broader indices by delivering sustained double-digit growth.TWTR stock has had some lumpy performances this year. On the positive end, that includes a big gap up after a strong first quarter. Since then though, shares have sold off despite key fundamentals holding true.A new prototype is underway, ad revenue is up considerably both domestically and internationally, and content partnerships are growing. Particularly, it's worth mentioning that Twitter announced a live-streaming partnership that provides fans with the ability to watch the second half of 20 NBA games through a unique, single-player view.This is all to say that big things are ahead for TWTR stock. And when it comes to disrupting digital media, you don't have the same confidence with AAPL stock. Twitter Is Becoming a News CenterApple may have rolled out its own news service in Apple News+, but reviews have been mixed. This indicates that merely having a large installed base isn't enough to get people to use your service. It takes more than putting some magazine content in a sleek format to get people to buy in.In contrast, Twitter is becoming a news center in its own right. Let's be clear that this isn't Pulitzer Prize winning journalism. But the brevity of the format and the real-time quality of the information coming from around the globe is a powerful way to get the highlights.As Twitter tinkers with a prototype app that makes the experience more conversational, it makes sense that more people, especially the younger generation, will gravitate toward this interactive news format.Though Twitter doesn't market themselves as being in the news business, there's definitely room to become something even bigger. Already today, tweets have the power to move markets. We have seen analysts keep a sharp eye on President Donald Trump's feed as news on trade talks has caused significant intraday swings.In summary, Twitter has the potential to become a much bigger force in media in the coming years. Better yet, TWTR stock is currently priced fairly. As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1363,-0.336,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street hasn’t been this down on Apple Inc. in a long time.Rosenblatt Securities downgraded the company to sell on Monday, bringing the total number of bearish analysts up to five, among the 57 ratings tracked by Bloomberg. Five is the highest number of sell ratings the iPhone maker has had since at least 1997, according to historical data compiled by Bloomberg. To put that into context, Apple wouldn’t release its iMac computer until August 1998, and the iconic iPod wouldn’t debut until October 2001.In another sign of the growing caution around the company, Apple’s consensus rating -- a proxy for the company’s ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings -- is currently 3.76, according to Bloomberg data. That’s the lowest since 2004.Skepticism surrounding the company has accelerated in 2019, with all five of the sell ratings coming in this year. Both New Street Research and HSBC lowered their ratings on the stock to sell in April, and in January, the number of firms with buy ratings dropped below 50% for the first time since 2004.The caution has been largely driven by uncertainty surrounding demand for the company’s critical iPhone line, with the U.S.-China trade war seen as a particular headwind. In January, Apple cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades, in large part because of iPhone weakness. Apple’s third-quarter results are currently expected to come out on July 30.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than 60% of Apple’s 2018 revenue was related to the iPhone, while roughly 20% came from China, which is also a critical part of its supply chain. Last week, Citi wrote that Apple’s China sales “could be cut in half” due to “a less favorable brand image desire.”Rosenblatt’s downgrade came as analyst Jun Zhang expects the company “will face fundamental deterioration over the next 6-12 months,” based on disappointing sales trends. The downgrade pushed Apple stock lower by as much as 2.9% in Monday trading.Still, the sell-equivalent ratings hardly represent a consensus view. A plurality of 23 firms recommend buying the stock, while another 21 have hold ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The 2019 caution hasn’t really been reflected in Apple’s stock performance. Shares are up more than 40% from its January low, though they remain about 14% below record levels.The news was not entirely negative for Apple on Monday, however, as Wedbush wrote it was “incrementally more positive on global iPhone demand” following checks in Asia. “We saw a ‘slight uptick’ out of Apple suppliers during our checks although overall handset demand remains challenging,” analyst Daniel Ives wrote. He affirmed his outperform rating and $235 price target.(Adds context in second paragraph, consensus rating in third, and stock performance in ninth.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.062,0.88,0.058,-1

Their founders were the same age. (Truth be told, they were both my age.) Both had a long period of failure, Apple in the 1990s and Microsoft in the 2000s.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut both have come roaring back as cloud czars. Microsoft committed to the cloud in 2014, Apple a few years later. Both have been worth over $1 trillion. Microsoft still is.While I own shares in both, the question is, which would I rather buy now? Where They StandAs trading opened July 5, Microsoft was selling for 30.5 times earnings and 9.4 times last year's revenue, Apple for just 17.2x earnings and 3.65x last year's revenue.Advantage, Apple.In its last fiscal year Apple brought 22% of its $265 billion in revenue to the net income line. Microsoft brought 16% of its $110 billion in revenue to the net income line.Advantage, Apple. * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice When they last reported earnings, three months ago, Apple had about $80 billion in cash and short-term securities on its books. Microsoft had $131 billion.Advantage, Microsoft.Apple's dividend of 77 cents/share represents a yield today of 1.52%. Microsoft's 46 cents per share dividend offers a yield of 1.35%.Advantage, Apple.Microsoft is currently more highly valued than Apple. Investors are more confident of its growth and prospects. But does this confidence have a basis in fact? Who Owns What?In the continuing war between the network edge and network core, now called devices and cloud, Apple controls the edge and Microsoft the cloud.Microsoft's cloud is a platform on which it, and other companies, build software that they deliver as services to customers around the world. Apple's cloud is built to create revenue from services, which now range from video and audio to payments and gaming.Neither has a dominant position in its core area. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more share of the cloud infrastructure market than Microsoft. Android from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has more share in the device market than Apple.Microsoft has an enormous share of wallet among its cloud customers, even though many use other clouds and their own data centers. Apple has an enormous share of wallet among its device customers, an ecosystem that's increasingly expensive to jettison.The question is where you would want to be in 2019, in the devices or the cloud? For now, investors have determined it's the cloud. Balance ShiftsThis could prove a bad bet, as the definition of devices changes.But there's another bet people are making with Microsoft, between being a brand and an ingredient.Spoken interfaces illustrate this. Apple's Siri is considered a success relative to Microsoft's Cortana, but Cortana doesn't need a smart speaker to succeed. Instead it lives inside other Microsoft products, just as the Azure cloud delivers software from companies like salesforce.com (NASDAQ:CRM) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 Microsoft is becoming more like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was 20 years ago, an ingredient brand, while Apple depends almost entirely on the consumer market for its earnings. Bottom Line on Microsoft StockIf I had a thousand dollars to put on either Apple stock or Microsoft stock today, I'd put it on AAPL. It's undervalued, relative to the market, while MSFT is overvalued.Both Apple and Microsoft will continue to rise so the best bet is to own both, as I do. These are core holdings for the decade of artificial intelligence that will be the 2020s. As has been true since they first went public in the 1980s, this is a choice where you may make a mistake in the short run, but in the long run you can't lose.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

1398,-0.9092,"Earnings season is invariably fraught with anxiety for investors. But this year the narrative about pandemic earnings recession is even more powerful. With no tax cut legislation to boost companies’ earnings, as was the case in 2018, they are expected to do worse by comparison to almost all quarters of this year.  Global Reasons for Downward Revisions  Yet were companies’ earnings dwarfed only by their profits made during the luckier year, analysts would probably sleep sounder now. Unfortunately, there are additional and more valid reasons for companies to reap lesser rewards in 2019. Economic growth in the US and other major global economic regions has slowed down and can be most generously characterized as only moderate. The prolonged trade war between the two largest economies and tariffs piled up by both sides are also taking a toll on companies’ performance and analysts’ evaluations of their earnings. The weakness of big multinational companies, whose earnings are predicted to drop by 9.3% in Q2, dampens everyone’s confidence in the prosperous economic future even further. The picture drawn by specialists is truly gloomy, firmly planting most of the companies’ earnings in negative territory. Across all sectors – electronics, semiconductors, telecommunication, construction, and technology – companies are anticipated to slide on average 2.6-3.1% in the second quarter and sink 0.3-0.8% in the third. It is only in the fourth quarter that a ray of light is supposed to pierce the gloom and bring companies’ earnings higher by 5.0-6.7%.Affected by economic and geopolitical uncertainties and analysts’ pessimistic expectations, companies have frantically begun to cut their profit forecasts for the second quarter. Only two weeks before earnings season, almost 82% of the companies have slashed their profit estimates. Although presenting more modest forecasts ahead of earnings reports is a common practice used to place companies’ achievements in a more favorable light post factum, the willingness with which they make downward revisions this year is unprecedented.  Pandemic Cuts of Earnings ForecastsLast time so many companies downgraded their profit expectations was in the third quarter of 2018, right before stocks tumbled 20%.  An equally negative outlook on their future profit companies expressed only in 2015, when markets were mostly in decline throughout the world. What is noteworthy about general pessimism this time is that it has overtaken not only struggling companies but also those who should feel secure about their earnings. Yet markets’ low spirits appear so pervasive that even such stable companies as Apple, Intel, and Boeing are trying to curb their excitement about their future profits. Analysts agree and often express only cautionary views on these companies’ achievements in the two next quarters of the year.  AppleAlthough Apple (AAPL: NASDAQ) finishes mostly in the green in all recent trading sessions, analysts advise investors to put buying of its shares on hold. Half of thirty-eight analysts discourage investors from making a purchase of Apple stocks at the moment. The main reason for their cautiousness stems from their negative attitude towards Apple’s payment platform that has been progressing slowly since 2014. Yet, as analysts think, the future performance of Apple stocks is inseparably connected to its ability to integrate its new services with its payment platform. If Facebook’s Libra takes the world by storm, Apple Pay can be outshined and ousted by it to the periphery of the payments industry. Made unpopular, Apple’s payment platform will surely negatively influence people’s sentiments towards its stocks. But even in the unlikely event of Libra’s failure to capture people’s hearts, Apple can be outperformed by Amazon Pay that, thanks to its substantial investments in India ($450 million), is gaining popularity not only in the West but also in Asia. If Amazon continues investing equally vigorously in the US and other regions, Apple’s payment platform will fall out of favor with people and bring its stocks down.   Even Apple’s recent improvements of its payment platform did not convince all investors that its stocks should be bought right now. Thus, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall maintains a neutral rating on AAPL, criticizing the company for not “offer[ing] any insights into App Store sales.” Other analysts advising investors to wait are more concerned with Jony Ive’s departure from the company, deemed to influence Apple’s stocks even more negatively than its failing payment platform. Referring to Apple’s former chief design officer as “one of the most important people at AAPL, second only to CEO Tim Cook, Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong suggested to investors to refrain from buying the company’s shares till better times. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets on Apple Inc BoeingBoeing’s situation ahead of the second quarter earnings results are even more complicated than Apple’s. The company has been threatened by tariffs on all fronts, simultaneously attacked by China and the European Union. Indeed, the influence that the prolonged trade war between the two largest empires has on Boeing (BA) is perhaps more damaging than that exerted on other companies.The imposition of additional tariffs from China, the most important export market, significantly restricts Boeing’s orders, considering that it is the largest American exporter. Transporting less goods will make the financial situation of the company even more shaky than it has been since its involvement in the long-running subsidiary dispute with the Aircraft. As estimated by the USTR, the EU subsidiaries to Aircraft have caused approximately $11 billion in economic harm to the US. Any new retaliatory tariffs might bring the troubled Boeing to the verge of financial crisis. With the grounded 737 Max aircraft added to Boeing’s misfortunes, it is little wonder that it has reduced its projections for the upcoming quarter. It is even less wonder that many analysts also express skepticism about Boeing’s earnings in 2019. Canaccord analyst Kenneth Herbert maintains that the problem with 737 Max goes beyond a simple software fix and is going to impact Boeing more negatively than its suppliers. Having lowered his price target on Boeing shares to $380, Herbert advises investors to forbear from buying its shares for the time being.David Strauss, a leading analyst at Barclays, followed suit and downgraded his rating on the company’s stocks. &quot;Our forecast reflects that MAX deliveries resume in Q4 with Boeing accumulating ~300 aircraft in storage while production only gradually increases beyond this to (57 per month) by early 2021,&quot; Strauss wrote. &quot;We think the production rate recovery will be slower to come through than anticipated as we believe the airlines are unlikely to take aircraft as quickly as prior to the grounding.&quot; Analyst Ratings & Price Targets on Boeing IntelThe majority of analysts consider that now are not the best times to buy Intel’s shares either. Out of thirty-seven analysts expressing their opinion on Intel’s earnings in the second and the third quarter, only nine recommend buying its stocks. Others advise people to hold their horses. Although it has consistently been finishing trading sessions in positive territory for the last several weeks, Intel (INTC) did not make a success story of its endeavors in the first quarter. The company lost over 23% of its value, which amounts to $45 billion taken off its market cap. Intel also lacks about $3 billion in cash, down from $15 billion at the end of 2015. Its long-term debt is over $25 billion. Looking at these unsatisfactory numbers, it is not surprising that advisors do not have great expectations concerning Intel’s earnings in the second and the third quarter of the year. Nick Dempsey from Barclays maintains a hold rating on Intel, and so does Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman. Their pessimistic outlook on the company chimes in with the opinion of many specialists who fear that Intel might eventually earn itself a place on the list of the companies with failed careers. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets on Intel CorporationThe second quarter of earnings results is only several weeks away. The mood of the companies poised to reveal their profits is not upbeat, judging by their hasty downward revisions of their earnings.

1405,0.9448,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Does world finance rest on faulty foundations? Models developed in academia in the 1950s and 1960s have come to dominate the way that bankers and investors do their work, and many blame them for the crash of 2008. But were the models really to blame?In this Masters in Business interview, Bloomberg’s John Authers and Christine Harper discuss the classic book that introduced the academic ideas that took Wall Street by storm: “Capital Ideas” by the late Peter Bernstein. It was the first selection in Bloomberg’s new experimental book club, Authers’ Notes, and it produced a torrent of feedback from readers who spent a month reading along with us.You can find a piece collating some of the main contributions here, while a transcript of an online discussion involving Christine, John, and Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal, a great investment columnist who was a friend of Bernstein’s, can be found on the terminal here. All the building blocks of modern finance, from the Efficient Markets Hypothesis through Modern Portfolio Theory to the Black-Scholes Theorem for pricing options were up for discussion.By far the most contentious issue in the models Bernstein covered turned out to be their treatment of risk. The models assume that risk can be summed up as volatility. Many now think that this was a dangerous over-simplification; but it is still terribly difficult to come up with anything better. More books will follow each month as Bloomberg continues its experiment: All thoughts are welcome. You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Bloomberg, Overcast and Stitcher.

Honestly, not much without fear of regurgitating a very popular, well-worn narrative.More importantly, the other reality is this up-and-coming market will see many more losers than winners. Even those that do survive will not guarantee today's purchase will be a good investment, let alone the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Stocks With Critical Levels to Watch Bearing this in mind, it's nice to dream about what might be. But I'd rather focus on making money today with the charts of these three marijuana stocks pointing at a profitable tomorrow and possibly longer-term endurance. Aurora Cannabis (ACB)  Click to EnlargeAurora Cannabis is the first of our marijuana stocks to put on the radar for purchase. As the monthly chart shows, ACB stock has been consolidating in a volatile congestion pattern for the past 1.5 years. But I believe Aurora's fairly difficult price action is close to taking on more meaningful and constructive bullish behavior.Last month ACB stock put together a higher low doji candlestick within its volatile uptrend. With the pattern finding support at the 50% retracement level from 2019's cycle low to high, a more durable reassertion of the trend looks compelling.Trading ACB StockMy recommendation is to buy ACB stock above the doji high of $8.16. My first price target for profit-taking is the March high of $10.32. For a stop-loss, the low of the June candlestick could be used. However, an exit below $7.50 which is the opening price of the monthly doji looks is seen as sufficient exposure off and on the price chart. Tilray (TLRY)  Click to EnlargeThere was a time when Tilray was at the top of the cannabis industry food chain, well at least in the eyes of investors. But the feasting on TLRY stock was short-lived. Tilray turned into a classic boom-bust story with shares tanking roughly 90% over the span of nine months.Today however, conditions are looking up. TRLY stock is offering potentially explosive gains if still fairly sour investor sentiment can continue to turn the corner after shares bottomed in June. Due to this marijuana stock's intense volatility, the weekly chart is how I'd approach buying shares in Tilray.Trading TLRY StockThe weekly chart is readying a purchase in TLRY stock above $51.03. This entry is the high from three weeks ago and the starting point for today's still-developing, flat basing pattern. Given this marijuana stock's volatile history, I'd estimate quick gains of 20% to 30% are certainly possible.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice On the downside, in respecting this short base breakout entry, it's crucial to keep an exit strategy tied to the formation's low. With risk of around 10% based on last week's low of $45.90, that's easy to appreciate technically and from a money management standpoint. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)  Click to EnlargeInnovative Industrial Properties is a momentum name within the universe of marijuana stocks. It's also not a producer, but actually a landlord for many of the sector's budding operators. IIPR is also a real estate investment trust, which means it even pays investors regular income. But please don't treat this one as a widows and orphans stock.As the weekly chart exemplifies, IIPR stock is a high-flyer. In fact, it has gained nearly 900% since hitting an all-time-low shortly after its 2017 IPO. And shares are up nearly 200% just this year. Nevertheless, I'm looking for this very friendly trend to continue if shares can break out from its current bullish candlestick pattern.Right now, and with one trading day left in the holiday-abbreviated week, this marijuana stock is taking on the shape of a bullish symmetrical triangle continuation pattern. And with stochastics backing up the price formation with an oversold crossover signal, IIPR is in position to go long.Trading IIPR StockThe recommendation for playing IIPR is to buy shares above $132. This allows for a bit of confirmation that the pattern breakout is real, without giving up too much in the way of profits.On the upside, if IIPR's momentum is going to reassert itself, I'd estimate $175 is possible based on a continuation move out of the pattern. To manage the position's downside exposure, I'd opt to exit below $125 to minimize losses. And as our chart hints at, this stop-loss also avoids getting potentially smoked in a much larger correction, which sooner or later is inevitable.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

However, on Wednesday the court once again ruled against the company.Source: Shutterstock That means Qualcomm faces the prospect of having to renegotiate many of its existing licensing agreements for smartphone modem technology. Doing so would have serious repercussions for future profits and QCOM stock.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice The markets were closed on Thursday for the holiday. In pre-trading, Qualcomm stock felt the impact of the latest ruling, dropping by as much as 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips QCOM Stock Down After Second Court LossQualcomm asked a U.S. District Court judge to stay the ruling made against the company in May, when it lost an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That ruling caused a rout in QCOM stock. Having the ruling stayed would have bought Qualcomm time during what is expected to be a lengthy appeal process.Both the FTC and South Korean electronics giant LG (which is currently in the process of negotiating smartphone agreements with QCOM) opposed the company's request. On July 3, the courts once again ruled against Qualcomm. The company must re-negotiate agreements with customers (including LG) based on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND) while it waits for its appeal to be heard. Doing so will gut QCOM's revenue and hammer its profits. The company complained the resulting agreements would &quot;upend&quot; the smartphone industry and hurt it for years to come even if it wins its appeal -- which is expected to take a year or more to wind through the courts.Though Qualcomm immediately announced it is appealing this latest ruling, it's not enough to prevent QCOM stock from taking a hit. A Long and Winding Legal RoadAs the company continues its journey through the U.S. legal system, it's proving to be a rocky road for QCOM investors.Investors were ecstatic at the end of April. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settled its long-standing legal battle with Qualcomm, paying QCOM royalties it had withheld and signing a six-year agreement to put Qualcomm modems back in iPhones. QCOM stock rocketed 24% in a single day on that news.Just a month later, storm clouds.On May 21, a U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the FTC, deciding that Qualcomm violated antitrust laws and had &quot;strangled competition.&quot; As a result, the company would be forced to negotiate licenses for its smartphone modem patents under FRAND terms directly to rival chip makers instead of forcing smartphone makers to pay. It's expected that doing so would reduce the royalties the company collects from the sale of a smartphone from &quot;several dollars to pennies.&quot;That would have a serious impact on revenue. As a result, Qualcomm stock went into a steep drop.It has been slowly recovering as investors gained hope that the request to stay the ruling while QCOM appealed would buy time -- a year at least, before the day of reckoning -- with the possibility Qualcomm would win.The judge's decision to deny Qualcomm's motion hits the company just as it's negotiating new 5G agreements with smartphone manufacturers like LG. The timing couldn't be worse and raises the very real prospect that even if it wins its eventual appeal against the FTC, Qualcomm could be saddled with agreements that cut into its profits for years to come. That's not great news for the company, or for QCOM stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1458,0.9891,"(Bloomberg) -- Osram Licht AG’s supervisory and managing boards accepted a 3.4 billion euro ($3.8 billion) takeover bid from Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, ending the German lighting company’s relatively brief and at times contentious period as a standalone company.Bain and Carlyle are offering 35 euros a share, 21% more than the stock’s close on Tuesday, amid reports about the latest offer. The price is still 15% lower than its peak this year in February. They’ve put a minimum acceptance level of 70% on the deal, excluding shares owned by Osram, and the acceptance period will run until early September. The stock rose 1.4% to 32.94 euros at the open of trading in Frankfurt.“Bain and Carlyle bring a lot of experience and have a deep knowledge of the industry,” Ingo Bank, Osram’s chief financial officer, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Friday. “They will help us build the portfolio.”Bloomberg reported earlier Thursday that Osram’s supervisory board was poised to accept the offer.After Siemens AG spun off the light bulb-making division in 2013, Osram Chief Executive Officer Olaf Berlien began to refocus on higher technology, sparking a bitter and public dispute over strategy. Bain and Carlyle’s purchase of Osram would add to the $51.6 billion in private equity buyouts of European companies announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Negotiations to buy Osram have moved slowly since they were first revealed in February. Funding has been a challenge as potential lenders raised concerns about future earnings forecasts for the company after Osram issued a string of profit warnings.Osram’s earnings deterioration during negotiations had a big impact on the deal, and the bidders also had concerns about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on business. Bain and Carlyle were able to push down the offer price, but also struggled to raise a significant amount of debt, people familiar with the matter said. In the end about 70% of the acquisition cost -- an unusually high proportion -- comes from equity, or cash contributed by the buyers, while the remainder will be borrowed money, the people said. The offer is unlikely to include a so-called material adverse change clause, one of the people said, a provision that would allow the buyer to withdraw from the transaction if certain negative events like a fresh profit warning arise. The buyout firms declined to comment.Osram suffered from a downturn in the automotive industry, yet there remain growth opportunities in that sector, including with autonomous vehicles and continued digital lighting, Bank said in the interview. Bain and Carlyle will be focused on margin improvement as well as growing the business, he added.What Bloomberg Opinion Says“It would require real guts to turn down what Bain and Carlyle are dangling. Osram was already in a weak state when news about the potential bid first emerged in November.”--Bloomberg Opinion columnist Chris HughesThe German company has struggled since it was spun off from Siemens. Berlien shifted Osram’s focus to high-tech specialized lighting and LED chips, although he’s failed to get a handle on weakening market demand as European car sales drop. He has also tried to branch out into new areas to attract revenue such as through the purchase of horticultural lighting maker Fluence.Bain and Carlyle support the company’s strategy, and the bid is “attractive to employees as a lot of the labor provisions will stay intact so, yes, we support the offer,” Bank said.Osram now has the task of getting shareholders on board. Given the board’s acceptance of the offer came just last night, Bank said the company “doesn’t have much feedback” from shareholders yet, but expects the bid to receive “very good support” from investors.The company is hoping to avoid the fate of other take-privates in Germany such as online classifieds operator Scout24 AG, where Blackstone Group LP and Hellman & Friedman in May failed to convince sufficient shareholders to sell amid pressure from hedge funds to boost the offer price.AMS InterestDuring negotiations with Bain and Carlyle, Austrian sensor manufacturer AMS AG made an informal approach about a potential takeover of Osram, according to people familiar with the matter. While there was some strategic fit to a deal, Osram decided against pursuing talks because of concerns about the feasibility of AMS to fund the transaction due to its size and debt levels, said the people.A representative for AMS, which has a market value of $3.4 billion and counts Apple Inc. among its key clients, declined to comment.Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Macquarie Group Ltd. are lead financial advisers to Bain and Carlyle, according to the statement.

1461,0.9912,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s quarterly profit more than halved after a global industry downturn and trade tensions hammered demand for its chips and high-end smartphones.Korea’s largest company reported a less-than-expected 56% fall in operating income to about 6.5 trillion won ($5.6 billion) in the June quarter -- but that was helped by an unspecified one-time gain from a customer that analysts estimate could have topped $800 million. The company won’t provide net income or break out divisional performance until it discloses final results toward the end of the month. Its shares slid 0.8% in Seoul.Samsung -- the world’s biggest producer of smartphone screens, semiconductors and mobile phones -- is grappling with plateauing demand in the face of an economic slowdown. Its memory chips remain a barometer for everything from computers to smartphones and have been one of the hardest-hit components since Trump administration tariffs took effect in May. Jitters over Samsung’s biggest cash cow grew this week when Japan slapped export restrictions on materials needed for display and chip production, potentially hammering also rival SK Hynix Inc.“Considering the structural downturn in memory prices and the mobile business, it’s unlikely Samsung would exceed earnings estimates” in the second half, Meritz Securities analyst Kim Sunwoo said in a report after the release. “As uncertainty over earnings have expanded on macro issues and around each division, the possibility of a special shareholder return plan has decreased significantly.”Unpredictability surrounding the trade war between the U.S. and China -- where Samsung earns the bulk of its revenue -- has sustained a downturn in the chip industry as smartphone demand tapers off and the pace of datacenter construction decelerates. Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. maker of computer memory chips, said last week it intended to “meaningfully” reduce its spending in its fiscal year 2020, on top of plans to idle 5% of production of memory chips in the last quarter.In the second quarter, contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell 19.3% compared to the previous quarter while those for 128 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips skidded 5%, according to inSpectrum Tech Inc. DRAM price drops are projected to widen to up to 15% in the current quarter and as much as 10% in the fourth quarter, TrendForce has estimated.“Memory prices are likely to keep sliding due to the ongoing trade war,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co., adding that shipments should be stable as Chinese customers who haven’t received products from U.S. chipmakers are likely to increase orders. “Samsung’s smartphone business will start to benefit from the U.S. ban on Huawei” in the second half, he added.Japan’s move to restrict the export of chip materials to South Korea also alarmed industry players because it threatened to derail domestic production. But some analysts say it could boost memory prices and remain hopeful that Japan won’t pull the plug on the world’s largest memory chip-making companies.A one-off gain for the display business assuaged some of Samsung’s pain. The company remains the foremost producer of high-margin organic light-emitting diode displays, but hit a snag last year when supplies to Apple Inc. suffered after the marquee iPhone X fared worse than expected.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSamsung Electronics will have to contend with weak demand for its components, even after being compensated by Apple for lower-than-expected iPhone shipments in 2Q. It will also need to clarify the impact of Japan’s export curbs on its components business.&#92;-- Anthea Lai, technology analystClick here to read the researchSamsung profit surpassed analysts’ average forecast for 6.1 trillion won thanks to a one-off gain. Its display division had sought financial compensation from Apple because actual shipments of OLED displays for iPhones fell short of contractual estimates, the Electronic Times has reported. The company could have secured as much as 1 trillion won in compensation from a U.S. customer, Citigroup Global Markets has estimated.But its chips division remains both the biggest driver of profit and the one most vulnerable to an economic downturn.“It will take more time to see the recovery of business sentiment for semiconductors,” IBK Securities analyst Kim Woon-ho wrote in a July 2 note. “Demand would rise in 2H but it will be lower than the prior estimates.”(Updates with shares and analyst’s comment from the second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Sam Kim and Michelle Seoh.To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.068,0.819,0.114,1

1464,0.9628,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s second-quarter numbers show just how bad the technology slump is.South Korea’s biggest company posted revenue and operating profit estimates that exceeded analyst expectations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet a single line in Friday morning’s statement hints at the weakness behind this apparent beat, disclosing that the estimates include a “one-time gain related to the display business.” Because this is only preliminary data, we don’t get to see the full sales and income breakdowns.Samsung sought compensation from Apple Inc. to make up for organic light-emitting diode panel orders that fell short of the iPhone maker’s initial expectations, South Korea’s Electronic Times reported two weeks ago. Citigroup Global Markets estimates that Samsung could have got as much as 1 trillion ($850 million) won compensation from a U.S. customer, Bloomberg News reported.On that basis, Samsung’s underlying operating profit would be closer to 5.5 trillion won, a three-year low. And operating margin would be closer to 9.8%, the lowest in five years, instead of the 11.6% based on preliminary earnings.There’s a deeper concern for investors. If Samsung did secure such compensation from Apple, then it means the Cupertino-based company will have to wear a cost of as much as $850 million for a product (displays) that it didn’t even buy.Furthermore, Apple is usually pretty good at predicting its needs – though it may sometimes overestimate in order to push suppliers to boost capacity. If Apple CEO Tim Cook and his team can’t get it right, there’s a high chance that others in the sector have  miscalculated demand and are holding onto supply estimates that remain too rosy.The overhang of climbing inventories and lengthening sale times has worsened in the past year, as I outlined in late June. Samsung’s latest figures add to a chorus of information that’s warning of weakness in the sector, and will chip away at the belief that the second half will be much better. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1470,0.9993,"Markets are still digesting the news from the personal between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at last weekend’s G20 economic summit. The key takeaways, of course, are that both leaders went into the meeting upbeat, got along well, and came out agreeing to hold further tariffs in abeyance while their negotiating teams resumed talks. It was personal diplomacy, done well, and investors breathed a heavy sigh of relief.That relief was reflected across a broad spectrum of the stock markets. The S&P 500, which closed at 2,995 on July 3, is up 2.8% from its most recent low point of 2,913 registered on June 26. We have already written in this space about gains in the semiconductor chip industry; now we’ll turn to the retail sector. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Our first stock stands at the junction of tech and retail. Apple is a giant in both fields, and so sensitive to pressures – market and political – from both directions. In the case of US-China trade tensions, Apple stood to lose from disruptions in its supply chain and its product markets. China is an important audience for the iPhone line, where Apple holds a 9.1% market share, and Chinese factories make up the lion’s share of iPhone’s final assembly.So, while Apple’s stock has been recovering well from reverses this past May and in the second half of 2018, the potential of a trade war between the two countries has tempered AAPL’s gains. The stock jumped, however, after Trump and Xi’s successful meet. At this writing, AAPL is up 3.3% since last Friday.This fresh burst of momentum comes at just the right time for Apple. The venerable tech leader saw its stock bounce back in June from losses in May, but that recovery had slowed by the end of the month. This week’s gains have put it back on track towards May’s high price of $210.Wedbush’s Daniel Ives drew the obvious conclusion from the news, saying, “Apple Inc. is “clearly” the biggest beneficiary of the weekend Group of 20 meeting that included direct talks between the U.S. and China.” He went on to add, “With the positive step in the right direction announced between the two countries to not levy additional tariffs while negotiations continue, in essence this takes away the biggest risk on the Apple story for now.” Ives sees room for growth in Apple’s stock. He sets a $235 price target, suggesting confidence in 15% upside.Although less certain of Apple’s future, Citigroup’s Jim Suva is suggesting that price volatility may be in store. He points out that Apple’s share in China’s smartphone market is feeling pressure from local competition, but add that he “remains optimistic on the Services segment with Apple Arcade to launch in the second half of 2019.” He maintains his ‘buy’ rating with a price target of $205, just a half-percent higher than the current share price.Apple’s analyst consensus rating is a ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 19 buys, 15 holds, and 2 sells given it in the last three months. The disparate opinions reflect the stock’s recent volatility, while the consensus reflects AAPL’s underlying reliability. The current share price is $204, with an average price target of $213, and an upside potential of 4.4%.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail AutoZone, Inc. (AZO)We’ve grown accustomed to sky-high share valuations, with Alphabet (GOOGL) trading at $1,122 and Amazon (AMZN) at an eye-popping $1,939, but one entry to the list of high-priced stocks may surprise you. AutoZone, the leading automotive spare parts and repair retailer, holds a stock valuation of $1,130.That valuation was lower last week. AZO slipped in the second half of June, when tensions rose between the US and China, and President Trump threatened additional tariffs. Since the positive meeting between Trump and Xi, however, AZO has gained 2.8% in share price.The sudden moves in AZO are due to the company’s significant exposure to US-China trade, and to the tariffs that the Administration was proposing. Company CEO Bill Rhodes, in the May 21 earnings conference call, put it bluntly: “We have a significant amount of products that come out of China. We don’t direct import a ton – less than 10% – but we have a lot of importers that bring it in from China, and then you also have a lot of our products where the components are being manufactured in China and the products are being assembled here.” Rhodes also was quite direct in admitting that AutoZone would simply pass on tariff-induced higher prices to its customers.The CEO’s reason for simply passing on higher prices – the inelastic demand nature of his business – lay behind Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel’s recent decision to upgrade AZO stock from ‘neutral’ to ‘buy.’ Nagel noted that AZO operates over 6,000 retail locations, has potential for “sustained strong commercial sales expansion.” He gives the stock a price target of $1,225, with an upside potential of 8.4%.AutoZone’s position in a business niche rich with potential customers – there are over 270 million registered automobiles in the US, and drivers have consistently shown over the years that they are willing to pay handsomely to keep them running – helps it maintain a ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus. The company has a unanimous 8 ‘buy’ ratings. As mentioned, shares are priced at $1,130. The average price target of $1,185 suggests an upside of 4.9% for AZO.View AZO Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Dollar General Corporation (DG)Discount retail, with its reliance on low-cost sourcing, is home to numerous companies that felt pressure from the potential trade war. Dollar General, which operates at the low end of the discount price spectrum, was described by Credit Suisse’s Judah Frommer as “the perfect candidate to get hit hard” by renewed tariffs. Frommer noted that DG imports between 40% and 42% of its merchandise directly from China.Direct exposure made DG vulnerable, but also set it up for appreciation when the trade tensions eased. Since June 28, Dollar General shares have seen a 2.9% gain and positive results in each of the last three trading sessions.Reduced pressure on import prices is not the only good news for Dollar General. At the end of May, the company reported positive quarterly results to start off FY2019, with top- and bottom-line growth, expectations beats for EPS and sales, and a dividend hike. Investors were happy, as were Wall Street analysts.Writing from BMO Capital, Kelly Bania gave DG a solid ‘buy’ rating with a price target of $140. Referring to the company’s improvements in grocery perishables, she said, “While no specific details were provided, we expect that DG has even more initiatives to come, including: more opportunities to leverage data, and potential ways to monetize DG’s growing, rural store footprint.”Oppenheimer’s Rupesh Parikh also took an upbeat view of DG, raising his price target to $150. Parikh says that he maintains DG as one of his Top Picks, and that “the bull case continues to strengthen.” His price target suggests an upside potential of 7.9%, significantly higher than the average.Dollar General’s consensus rating is a ‘Strong Buy.’ Like AutoZone, the analysts are unanimous on this stock – the consensus is based on 14 buys assigned in three months. The average price target, $142, suggests an upside of 2.5% from the current share price of $139. The modest upside reflects the tight margins typical in the deep discount retail sector.View DG Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Like Dollar General, Walmart inhabits the discount retail sphere. The company, famous for its price rollbacks, is also the world’s largest retailer and private employer, so while Walmart faced trade war pressure on its low-cost merchandise sourcing, its sheer size gave it leverage in keeping that pressure as low as possible.However, even a $320 billion giant like Walmart could not avoid the economic or geopolitical realities. CFO Brett Biggs, in relation to trade tensions, said in May, “We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low. That's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices, we believe, for our customers.”Walmart’s large grocery section – food items and other groceries make up more than half of the company’s sales, and are primarily sourced from the US and South America – reduced its exposure to China trade, but did not eliminate it. UBS analyst Michael Lasser estimates that 26% of Walmart’s products are imported from Chinese suppliers. With a more moderate exposure to potential tariffs, Walmart also saw more moderate gains when the threat of tariffs faded. WMT shares are up 1.8% since last Friday.Wall Street’s analysts are impressed with the company’s continued resilience in the face of various challenges, be they potential tariffs or increased competition from digital retailers. KeyBanc’s Edward Yruma noted WMT’s underappreciated acquisition of the PhonePe payments app as typical of the management’s forward vision. He said, “PhonePe recently added financial services, which we think should be the primary revenue driver. We see a $14B+ valuation opportunity over the medium term. PhonePe underscores WMT's openness to growth opportunities beyond physical retail, and we raise our WMT price target to $125 on continued confidence in WMT's ability to innovate.” Yruma gives Walmart a $125 price target, suggestive of an 11% upside potential.Five-star financial blogger Laura Hoy describes Walmart as a stock that “every 30-year old should buy and hold forever.” She acknowledges the challenge from e-commerce, and adds, “WMT stock has made an impressive recovery and although the firm is still facing some headwinds, it’s a solid stock to buy. Judging by the company’s improving e-commerce sales, it looks like Walmart is on the right track to compete against the likes of Amazon.”Walmart holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on 8 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell. The slightly mixed nature of those ratings reflects the headwinds the Hoy pointed out, primarily the challenge of e-commerce. WMT shares sell for $112, and the average price target is $114, yielding an upside of just 1.8%. Like Dollar General, the low upside goes along with the discount retail industry’s thin profit margins.View WMT Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailVisit TipRanks’ Daily Analyst Ratings to find out which stocks the Street’s best analysts are looking at now.",0.046,0.825,0.129,1

1483,-0.4814,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. can’t avoid renegotiating many of its licensing agreements while the company appeals a judge’s ruling that its business model is anti-competitive.The order comes six-weeks after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh sided with the Federal Trade Commission and issued a series of injunctions against Qualcomm’s licensing and sales practices. Koh concluded Wednesday there’s no reason to halt the injunctions while the appeal is pending.Koh found that Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy unfairly leveraged the company’s market position to force customers to pay inflated prices for chips and royalties for their technology. She ordered the company to end the policy and renegotiate some of its contracts for chips and royalties.Qualcomm said it will immediately ask San Francisco’s federal appeals court to stay Koh’s May ruling.Qualcomm faced off with the FTC in an 11-day trial in January. Koh’s May ruling provided near blanket support for the FTC’s arguments. The decision not only raises uncertainty over the future of Qualcomm’s business model, but it threatens to upend the smartphone industry now in the early stages releasing new 5G mobile technology worldwide.The order was a shock to Qualcomm and investors who expected a softer touch by Koh after the chipmaker and Apple Inc. struck a settlement in a similar lawsuit less than a month before her opinion. Instead, Koh described Qualcomm as having ”strangled competition...for years” by requiring customers to pay licensing royalties when ordering new mobile phone chips.(Updates with judge’s conclusion in second paragraph. An earlier version of this story corrected the day the order was issued.)&#92;--With assistance from Ian King.To contact the reporter on this story: Kartikay Mehrotra in San Francisco at kmehrotra2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Heather SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.067,0.885,0.048,-1

1499,0.9995,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) ambitions in the digital-wallet industry will propel it into a head-on clash with Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) recently announced cryptocurrency, known as Libra. This clash will have a major impact on AAPL stock. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the past few quarters, Facebook has faced a lot of trust and privacy issues. But the scope of its cryptocurrency project reveals the large extent of its aspirations in this industry. On the other hand, Apple launched its payments platform in 2014 and since then it has been  progressing slowly. The future performance of AAPL stock is closely linked to the company's ability to seamlessly integrate its new services with its payments platform. Heavy share buybacks can help Apple stock in the near-term, but the long-term returns of AAPL stock will depend on AAPL's fundamentals.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Apple has very low market share in some overseas regions, reducing its ability to expand Apple Pay. The digital-wallet industry in the U.S. and other regions could end up being very similar to China's digital-wallet sector. In China, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA, which owns the country's largest e-commerce website and Tencent (OTC: TCEHY), the owner of its largest messaging.multi-purpose app, control over 90% of the digital-wallet industry.In this business, the most popular social media and retail platforms have a big advantage due to the large number of customers they have. Despite Apple's best efforts, Apple Pay could end up becoming a small player in the rapidly evolving payments industry. That will hurt Apple's Services business and its margins.If Libra's launch is successful and it is widely accepted, the sentiment towards Apple stock will certainly be negatively impacted. Apple's Progress Versus Facebook's AmbitionsApple has recently raised the bar on its payments business by joining hands with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to launch a credit card called Apple Card. According to Bloomberg, AAPL is already testing this card among thousands of Apple Store employees. Apple launched its payments platform in 2014 and since then it has been slowly adding new features. But Apple could end up being a laggard in the payments industry, as other players are ramping up their own payments platforms.Facebook recently announced its own cryptocurrency which has already received a lot of attention. Even central bankers around the world have given their opinion on this new platform. Facebook certainly faces a major &quot;trust deficit&quot; due to a number of missteps it has made. The privacy issues surrounding FB's main social media platform are also a headwind for Libra. But Facebook should be applauded for its boldness. If successful, Libra could provide banking options to the underbanked regions of the world, making the currency quite useful.Despite FB's privacy issues, I believe the future success of Libra or any other payments platform primarily depends  on its usability. Both Alibaba and Tencent have shown this with their respective digital wallets in China. Facebook's massive user base should help it rapidly grow its new payments platform. FB can eventually use the platform to enter services which Apple is targeting. Close to 50% of the population in China uses a  mobile-payment system, according to eMarketer. In terms of market share, Alibaba's Alipay has 54%, while Tencent has 40%. Apple Pay has also been launched in China, but it's not used very much there. If the trend in the U.S. ends up being similar, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Facebook will have the biggest market share in the digital-wallet space due to their retail and social media ecosystem, respectively. This will have a significant negative impact on the future returns of AAPL stock. Other ChallengersPrior to Facebook, Apple was already facing competition from other tech giants in the payments industry. Amazon is looking to ramp up its investment in this space. Amazon Pay recently invested INR 4.5 billion ($65 million) in India. In the past three years, it has invested INR 30 billion (approximately $450 million) in Amazon Pay in India. Amazon has also recently launched flight booking and other new features to attract more transactions on Amazon Pay in India. It is likely that Amazon  will make bigger investments in Amazon Pay in other international regions and the  U.S. market in the near-term.Like AMZN, Apple has a lot of resources and very high free cash flow. But AAPL's management has not invested aggressively in an effort to make Apple Pay more popular. Amazon can monetize Amazon Pay through its retail platform. However, Apple does not have a similar option. This could be one of the reasons why Apple is much more reluctant to invest in its payments platform. Amazon has recently launched a secured credit card. Prime users get  5% cash back on the products they  purchase from Amazon using the card. This shows that Amazon can use multiple incentives to attract new customers to its payments platform. Ideally, Apple could have built digital-payments platform that would be geared to all the retail competitors of Amazon, but it has not done so. It should also be noted that Apple's market share in several international regions is very low. Apple's sells less than 2 million  iPhones per year in India. On the other hand, there are hundreds of millions of users on Facebook and Whatsapp in India. Even in Europe, the market share of Apple is nowhere close to its market share in the U.S. In Germany, AAPL has a market share of 21.1%, while in France it is just 20.2%.Source: Kantar Impact on Margins and Other ServicesA successful payments platform can be used to develop and popularize new financial products. This has been shown by both Alibaba and Tencent in China. It also helps to  make new services more popular. As a result, it is very important for Apple, which is betting on services to drive the future growth of the company and raise AAPL stock. to have a strong payments platform.  The Bottom Line on AAPL StockFacebook has made an audacious attempt to build a new cryptocurrency-based payments system, creating another big challenge for Apple Pay. Amazon is already ramping its investments in and the initiatives of its payment system, both overseas and in the U.S.. A strong payments platform could be very lucrative because it enables the launch of new financial products and the increased monetization of current customers.Apple Pay has already been limited to a very small market share in China. If the digital-payment initiatives of Facebook and Amazon are successful, the market share of Apple Pay in the U.S. and overseas could also be very small, increasing the headwinds facing Apple stock.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any companies named.

1504,0.9964,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When I heard on Tuesday night that Lee Iacocca had passed away, I was momentarily taken aback. Not so much because he had died — he was, after all, 94 — but because, for someone who had been such a larger-than-life figure for so much of his career, he had been out of the limelight for so long.Iacocca first burst into the public consciousness in 1963, when he made the covers of both Time and Newsweek(1) in the same week, standing in front of the brand new Ford Mustang, which he had (allegedly) masterminded as a top Ford executive. His last public act took place in 1995, when he and the financier Kirk Kerkorian made a foolhardy attempt to take over Chrysler. Although he later formed an investment company, and dabbled in this and that, this once unforgettable figure spent the last two decades of his life, well, forgotten.In the headline of its obituary, the New York Times described Iacocca as a “Visionary Automaker Who Led Both Ford and Chrysler.” And that’s true, so far as it goes. Having accrued most of the credit for the Mustang, he was promoted to Ford’s president by the time he was 46. But in 1978, even though Ford was going great guns, Henry Ford II fired him. Supposedly, Ford said he was canning Iacocca because he didn’t like him.Then came his tenure at Chrysler, which was on the brink of collapse when he took it over. He persuaded the federal government to give the company $1.5 billion in loan guarantees, and used that money to orchestrate a brilliant turnaround, spearheaded by the Chrysler minivan — a car that, in addition to making the company gobs of money, had a profound impact on American society. (Just ask any parent.)All well and good.But Iacocca influenced the culture in another way as well. The celebrification of chief executives can be traced directly to him. Yes, there had been other famous corporate chieftains before Iacocca — John D. Rockefeller and Walt Disney come to mind — but they were the exceptions to the rule that CEOs should be low-key, boring even. Iacocca(2) made it okay for a chief executive not just to gain fame, but to desire it.When had a chief executive made himself the centerpiece of his company’s ad campaign before Iacocca did it at Chrysler? When had one made himself a selling point in asking Congress for help? Or taken a public victory lap the way Iacocca did after the Chrysler turnaround, posing for magazine covers from Life to the Saturday Evening Post? Or publicly muse about running for president? Oh, and when had a chief executive written an autobiography that became one of the best-selling books of all time? Not business books, mind you. Books. Published in 1984, there were more than 7 million copies sold by the end of the following year.After Iacocca did it, other CEOs put themselves in their companies’ ad campaign: Dave Thomas, founder of the Wendy’s Co., and Victor Kiam, who owned Remington Products Co., maker of electric shavers. (His tag line: “I liked it so much, I bought the company.”) CEOs became less bashful about granting interviews and posing for magazine covers. (By 2002, Bill Gates had posed for Fortune’s cover 25 times.) Or bragging about their accomplishments to anyone who would listen. (I’m talking to you, Jack Welch.)And then there were the ghost-written CEO autobiographies, which poured forth into bookstores after the success of “Iacocca: An Autobiography.” “Pizza Tiger,” by Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino’s Pizza Inc. “Work in Progress,” by Michael Eisner, former chief executive of The Walt Disney Co. “Straight From the Gut,” by Welch, CEO of General Electric Co. “Sam Walton: Made in America,” by Walmart Inc. founder Sam Walton. “Father, Son & Co.: My Life at IBM,” by Thomas Watson Jr.(3) And lest we forget: “The Art of the Deal,” by Donald Trump. That came out three years after Iacocca’s book.I never covered Iacocca myself, but I’ve long realized that much of my career has been spent taking advantage of the trail he blazed. My very first business story, in 1982, was about T. Boone Pickens’s first hostile takeover attempt, which I wrote for Texas Monthly. When Pickens decided to write his autobiography a few years later, he hired me as his ghostwriter. (It ended badly for me, but that’s a story for another day.)During my decade at Fortune, getting to know CEOs, interviewing them, writing stories about them — and getting them to pose for the cover — was at the heart of the enterprise. I did a short documentary about Warren Buffett. At the New York Times, my readership always spiked when I wrote a column about Steve Jobs and Apple. Now at Bloomberg, I still find myself drawn to columns about CEOs. Readers care about the comings and goings of chief executives in a way they never did before Lee Iacocca.So I guess what I should say as I bid adieu to Iacocca is simply this: Thank you. Maybe that’s what we should all say.(1) And those were the days when making the cover of Time or Newsweek really meant something!(2) I should also note that Iacocca wasn’t just a business celebrity but an Italian-American celebrity. In 1963, when he first became famous, that was something Italian-Americans took pride in; by the time he left Chrysler in the 1990s, Italian-American celebrities had become no big deal. That’s progress.(3) For the record, the Watson book, written with Peter Petre, is in my view, the best CEO autobiography ever written. It is a deeply personal account of not just running a company but dealing with a larger-than-life father, who founded IBM.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

1511,0.9972,"Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is a massive company, focused on entertainment. Its properties -- which include television networks, movies studios and theme parks -- brought in $59.43 billion in revenue last year. DIS stock has exploded since April and the catalyst has been excitement over the company's forthcoming Disney+ video streaming service. With Disney stock trading just off its all time record high at $142.53, the company now has a market cap of over $256.5 billion. But there's a far bigger entertainment market than video streaming, and one that Disney is largely absent from.Source: Disney A Disney investor is calling on the company to make a return to the video game market, with an acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).   Report: Investor Calls for Disney to Buy Activision BlizzardBloomberg reports that investment firm Gerber Kawasaki is calling on Disney to buy video game publisher Activision Blizzard. Gerber Kawasaki counts Disney stock among its top three holdings, and also owns roughly $4.3 million worth of Activision stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy the call for Disney to make what would be one of the most expensive acquisitions in its history? While DIS stock has skyrocketed this year, Activision has been going the opposite direction. It's down 43% since last October. Gerber Kawasaki sees Activision as a takeover target. So do others. JPMorgan listed Activision as a potential acquisition for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earlier this year. However, even at its current reduced market cap of $37 billion, Activision Blizzard would be a huge investment, and would represent the second largest Disney acquisition ever -- after the company's $71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox.That's a big move, but one that could have some serious upside for Disney stock price. The Booming Video Game Industry Could Power Future Disney Stock GrowthAs mentioned earlier, Disney stock growth since April has been driven by the company's Disney+ video streaming service, which launches in November. It's expected to make Disney a big player in the video streaming market, which is on track to hit $83.41 billion in value globally by 2022. That sounds great, and investors have clearly been impressed by the prospect of DIS grabbing a chunk of that revenue.But the global market for video games is worth $152.1 billion this year. For the past eight years, the video game industry has earned more than the movie and music industries combined -- and it isn't even close. Disney owns some of the most recognizable characters in pop culture, from its own mascots like Mickey Mouse, to Pixar's creations, and the Marvel and Star Wars franchises. There is massive potential for the company to leverage those characters in video games, grabbing a chunk of that $152 billion and boosting the Disney stock price even further.As Bloomberg notes, Disney already has ties with Activision, with a multiyear deal to televise its esports Overwatch League. Could that relationship -- and the lure of the massive video game market -- lead to something more?  Disney's Dark Video Game Past Naturally, Disney has thought of all this before. It's gone down the path of buying video game studios with the goal of leveraging its properties, but the results have never been pretty. The company bought and then shuttered at least six video game studios in a decade-long period, where it invested billions of dollars then ended up walking away. Instead, Disney chose to licence its properties to video game studios, as CEO Bob Iger explained to investors (via Business Insider):&quot;We feel like we're better off managing the risk that the business delivers by licensing instead of publishing.&quot;Disney's corporate culture hasn't meshed with the very different way successful video game publishers operate, including the huge expenditures now involved to bring in those big paydays. Disney's Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released in 2015 with a production budget of $245 million, the movie brought in a global box office of just over $2 billion. That's an impressive return, but compare it to Grand Theft Auto V. The video game is reported to have cost over $250 million, but with that risk has come sales of over $6 billion -- making the game the most successful media property in history, outperforming any movie.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice The opportunity is there for Disney to make a move back to the video game industry, and the growth potential for revenue and Disney stock with such a move is huge. But to do it right this time, Disney would need to overcome its past aversion to risk and big budgets for video games. Otherwise, history says an Activision acquisition would be an expensive bust.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1518,0.9881,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. has completed a two-month redesign of the Galaxy Fold to fix embarrassing screen failures that forced its delay, people familiar with the matter say, allowing the Korean giant to debut its marquee smartphone in time for the crucial holiday season.The world’s largest smartphone maker is now in the final stages of producing a commercial version but can’t yet pin down a date to begin sales, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified describing an internal effort. Samsung pulled the device after several publications including Bloomberg News reported problems with test versions, such as screen malfunctions that emerged after a film on the display was peeled off.Korea’s biggest company is trying to move past yet another product faux pas. It has now stretched the protective film to wrap around the entire screen and flow into the outer bezels so it would be impossible to peel off by hand, said the people, who have seen the latest versions. It re-engineered the hinge, pushing it slightly upward from the screen (it’s now flush with the display) to help stretch the film further when the phone opens.That tension makes the film feel harder and more a natural part of the device rather than a detachable accessory, they added. The consequent protrusion, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, may help reduce the chance of a crease developing in the middle of the screen over time, one of the people said.Samsung is keen to salvage its reputation after canceling the April 26 launch of the $1,980 device when folding displays on review models exhibited problems. It had counted on the world’s first mass-produced foldable smartphone to challenge Apple Inc. and widen its lead over Chinese rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. Instead, some models developed issues after mere days of use: Bloomberg’s test unit failed to function properly after a plastic layer covering the screen was removed, and a small tear developed at the top of the hinge where the gadget opened.Samsung will soon start shipping major components for the Galaxy Fold, including the display and battery, to a main plant in Vietnam for assembly while the company debates a launch date, one of the people said. But the company is unlikely to unveil its re-upholstered Galaxy Fold during an Aug. 7 “Unpack” event in New York for the new flagship Note 10 phone, one of the people said. A Samsung representative declined to comment.The Fold’s postponement marked a setback for a company that had bet on its latest innovation to extend its dominance and ignite a stagnating smartphone market. But the Suwon, South Korea-based firm was keen to avoid the kind of fiasco it suffered in 2016 when it recalled the Note 7, which showed a tendency to burst into flames. Samsung also finds itself in no rush to launch the Galaxy Fold after Huawei postponed the roll-out of its own foldable device, the person said.Samsung’s shares slid 1.8% Wednesday while South Korea’s benchmark Kospi fell 1.2%.Read More: Samsung’s Reputation Founders on Rush for Lead in Folding PhonesFoldable phones let users double their screen real estate while also keeping devices compact enough to fit into a pocket. But analysts say it’s unclear whether companies can develop apps to take full advantage of the innovative screen. Samsung’s delay underscored the challenges of creating a display that folds like a notebook, something Samsung spent eight years trying to master.Even if the phone is made to perfection, the market may not be ready for it: Samsung shipped more than 290 million phones last year, according to Strategy Analytics, but said earlier this year it would produce about 1 million foldable phones in 2019.Samsung, which supplies the organic light-emitting diode screens used in Apple iPhones, is also developing a clamshell-like foldable phone and has already created dozens of prototypes, one of the people said.Bloomberg News reported in March Samsung was working on a pair of new foldable models to follow the Galaxy Fold, including one that folds vertically and another that folds outward like Huawei’s Mate X. The company also envisions smartphones with rollable and stretchable displays in the future, Samsung Executive Vice President Chung Eui-suk said in February.(Updates with Samsung’s shares in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.net;Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, ;Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.056,0.841,0.103,1

It is worth noting President Donald Trump previously singled out the EU as a trade offender.The U.S. is already imposing tariffs on $21 billion worth of EU goods. The new $4 billion worth of tariffs, if enacted, could apply to indulgences such as coffee, tea and whiskey.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Still, the U.S.-EU trade tiff is not on par with the recent wranglings with China. As such, equities did not endure significant punishment today. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.22% while the S&P 500 added 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.26%. Dow Jones Loser: NikeBefore getting into some of today's Dow winners, let's take a look at Nike (NYSE:NKE), one of Dow's Tuesday losers with a loss of almost 1%. It is doubtful that Tuesday's loss represents the start of material declines for Nike stock, but today's action in the athletic apparel giant is endemic of the current political environment in the U.S.Nike was prepared to launch sneakers featuring the Betsy Ross version of the American flag. Former NFL football player Colin Kaepernick, a Nike endorser, complained that the flag was used during a period of slavery in the U.S. Nike decided to scrap the sneaker.It did not end there. Admonishing the perceived political correctness, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he would yank the financial incentives his state offers Nike if the Betsy sneaker is pulled. Today's Dow Jones WinnersHats off to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for leading the way in the Dow today. On seemingly no company-specific news and below-average volume, the telecommunications giant jumped 2.59%. In the stocks favor today is this: Verizon did not rally simply because investors favored defensive stocks today. Many of the Dow's Tuesday winners were not boring or defensive stocks.Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) nudged up 0.59%, but some analysts are forecasting volatility for the iPhone maker between now and its next earnings date on July 30.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva &quot;estimated revenue of $52.6 billion, with iPhone revenues down 12% to $25.76 billion, and profits of $2.06 per share,&quot; reports Barron's. For Apple's June quarter, those figures are below consensus estimates.In a few months, Apple will likely unveil a new iPhone. Some analysts are not expecting major hardware improvements and it is expected the company will not have 5G-compatible phones out until 2020.Visa (NYSE:V) had a decent day, rising 0.77% after Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) recently unveiled Libra digital currency does not present a significant threat to Visa. Visa investors may get more word on that when the company reports earnings on July 23. Bottom LineWe've discussed several times in this space the aftermath of U.S.-China trade talks and their implications. That aftermath is here and while there will be ongoing talks between the two sides, for now, investors are asking, &quot;what's next?&quot;Recent global economic points have been sluggish, a scenario that if persistent, puts burden on various central banks -- including the Federal Reserve -- to act. That means investors should focus on monetary policy and earnings over the next several weeks. Those will be the clues for broader market direction this summer.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1529,0.9119,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. is under scrutiny by European antitrust regulators who want information on whether the social network uses its size to squeeze smaller rivals.The European Commission has sent questionnaires to Facebook’s customers and competitors about a range of practices, according to two people familiar with the matter. Companies have been asked to respond by next week, said one of the people. They asked not to be named because the inquiry is in its early stages and not public.Officials are looking at Facebook’s sales platform and how it uses and shares data from apps, one of the people said.The European Commission declined to comment, and Facebook didn’t respond to a request for comment. MLex reported the EU’s move earlier on Tuesday.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s antitrust chief, said last year she was interested in leaked Facebook emails that included a threat to cut off data access to potential rivals. Facebook has become a punching bag for European regulators after revelations that it allowed the data of millions of users to be shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.The EU is also looking at how Amazon.com Inc. collects data from retailers through its platform, one of several cases examining whether internet firms play fair. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have attracted antitrust complaints over how they treat competitors.Separately, Facebook is facing privacy probes over its policies and data breaches and was fined by the EU for failing to give correct information during the regulatory review of its WhatsApp takeover. The EU’s information-gathering may allow Vestager’s successor to decide whether to move forward with a probe after Vestager leaves office this year.&#92;--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Heather Smith at hsmith26@bloomberg.net, David GlovinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.042,0.864,0.095,1

1534,0.9745,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last year was among the worst for so-called value stocks based on data going back to 1925, according to Andrew Ang, director of BlackRock Inc. ’s $210 billion factor strategies group and this week's guest on Masters in Business. But here's the key: holding value stocks during short periods of poor performance is the secret to longer-term outperformance versus growth stocks.Ang, a former finance professor at Columbia Business School and author of &quot;Asset Management: A Systematic Approach to Factor Investing&quot; believes that this behavioral element is what underlies the value component of factor investing. Despite the well-documented long-term advantages of value over growth, institutional managers suffer from career risk when it comes time to do nothing and ride out the decline. Counterintuitively, professionals must give up alpha (market outperformance) if they want to hold on to their jobs. That and other insights from Ang’s 15 years teaching at Columbia is why he consulted for a variety of large institutions, including the $1 trillion Norway sovereign wealth fund.In our wide-ranging conversation, Ang explains why factor investing is a way to manage risk and enhance returns. Building on the classic Fama-French three-factor model (size, value and market risk), Ang focuses on five specific factors: value, size, quality, volatility and momentum. He also sees areas beyond equities as being subject to factor analysis, including fixed income, commodities and currencies. He believes the application of data and technology leads to scale and lower costs.He also points out that individual factors are themselves subject to factors -- &quot;meta-factors” -- that value at times can become cheaper or more expensive (e.g., relative to its own history), and that there can be momentum to momentum (e.g., relative strength).His favorite books are here; the transcript can be found here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Bloomberg, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Overcast and Stitcher.

1551,0.9976,"Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best Stocks for 2019 contest. John Jagerson and Wade Hansen's pick for the contest is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).Since December 2018, we have been recommending Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a long position because its fundamentals are undervalued. ADBE's market position is dominant in its media products and the company has been steadily growing by adapting its Creative and document management solutions to mobile. We feel that these factors will protect the company from the emerging economic headwinds both in the U.S. and outside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom a technical perspective, ADBE has been able to outperform its benchmark indexes and most of its peers despite a choppy year for stocks so far. Now that we have another two quarters of data since we began recommending ADBE stock, it's time to revisit our analysis and see if we can still make the same judgement. Valuing ADBEWe believe that ADBE's ability to grow its profit margins has positioned it well in each of its three main segments: Digital Media, Digital Expertise and Publishing. The media segment includes their Creative products like Photoshop and their document services, which accounts for more than 70% of their revenue.The most recent quarterly report on June 18 showed Creative revenues were up by 22% on a year-over-year basis. The emphasis on services and subscriptions has increased ADBE's gross margin to 85% and net margins are at 23% over the same period. The company did suffer a little over the last two quarters due to adverse currency conversion rates, but to put it in perspective, from a margin standpoint, ADBE is outperforming Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); it's also just behind the most recent report from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate Besides the favorable comparison between ADBE and their peers, we believe the company's growth has not been fully priced into the stock. As you can see in the following chart, revenue and EPS have been rising with the stock's price, but its earnings multiple remains near historical lows. If we were to adjust the EPS line to use constant dollars, the trend of the P/E ratio and EPS would be even more impressive.  Click to EnlargeThe point behind a value-price comparison like this is to determine if investors are paying more, or less, for each dollar of earnings than they have in the past. Because growth is still strong, paying less for the stock now indicates the likely probability that the shares are still undervalued. Technical PositionLike the stock averages themselves, ADBE's share price drew down in April and May as traders worried about the impact of slowing economic growth and the trade war. Total revenue from the Europe Middle East Africa (EMEA) region was 27% in the most recent quarter and 15% was from Asia. Outside the US, economic performance and stock markets haven't recovered from the bear market of late-2018 to the extent the U.S. has, and we feel this has also dragged on ADBE's share price.However, ADBE's current technical breakout following their earnings report from an inverted &quot;head-and-shoulders&quot; pattern looks to be a strong bullish momentum signal. This stock tends to have reliable technical patterns which we have been commenting on in our previous recommendation updates including the double bottom in February, bullish diamond in April, and the double-bottom retest at the beginning of June.  Click to EnlargeIn the short term, a Fibonacci-based target of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern would indicate an upside target in the $313 per share range. Historically, patterns like this can play out very quickly, but 60-days is closer to the long-term average. A Few Issues to Watch for AdobeAs previously mentioned, a quarter of Adobe's sales come from Europe. Adobe may see its revenues softening, especially in document services if the European economy continues to weaken and the Brexit outlook gets worse due to new conservative leadership in the U.K. Adobe's continual investment in developing end-to-end document signing and processing puts it at the forefront of the global supply chain. However, recent trade wars could stall that income growth in the short term.The company has placed an emphasis on lower-end media solutions and document management that are focused on mobile users which should help insulate the company from some economic issues because these products are broadening their customer base. We believe the long-term impact of this focus will be similar to what happened when the company shifted to cloud-based services and will increase margin growth.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying As noted in ADBE's recent earnings release, a rising dollar was a negative for earnings. The Fed is hinting at a strong possibility of interest rate cuts in the short term, which could help weaken the dollar and improve performance. However, even with the Fed's potential cuts in July and December, the battle for a cheaper currency may be tough to win against the European Central Bank (ECB) which has promised to be ready with easing of its own if market conditions worsen in Europe. This is a systemic issue that will affect most large companies but is something to keep your eye on this summer.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

1584,0.9082,"(Bloomberg) -- Rico Zorkendorfer, among several members of Apple Inc.’s industrial design team to leave the company in recent months, has joined Bumblebee Spaces, a startup seeking to merge robotics with home furnishings.Zorkendorfer left Apple in April and is now leading design at the San Francisco-based startup that is combining smart home products and robotics, Sankarshan Murthy, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, told Bloomberg News. Bumblebee Spaces has developed beds, closets and storage containers attached to robot actuators that allow the furnishings to be raised into ceilings, increasing the amount of space in an apartment. For example, a room can be an open space living room during the day with a bed that comes down from the ceiling at night.At Bumblebee Spaces, Zorkendorfer is leading the design of the company’s furnishings, consumer interactions and the look of its smartphone app, Murthy said. Before leaving Apple, Zorkendorfer worked on a number of devices, including the Apple Watch, during his more than 15 years at the company. As a member of Apple’s industrial design group of about two dozen people under Jony Ive, Zorkendorfer was key to the iPhone maker’s product launches.Ive announced Thursday that he’s leaving Apple after about three decades to form his own design company.Read more: Inside Apple’s Long Goodbye to Design Chief Jony IveFew of Apple’s industrial designers left the company for most of its history, but Zorkendorfer was one of at least three to depart in the past six months and among six who have left in the past three years.Bumblebee, started in 2017, said it’s selling products to apartment building landlords and individual condominium owners and has started installations in San Francisco and Seattle. The startup has received funding from Loup Ventures and others.

1590,0.9862,"The old Wall Street saying &quot;buy the rumor, sell the news&quot; was in full effect Monday. Following news released over the weekend that the U.S. and China are willing to restart trade talks, accompanied by some encouraging tweets from President Donald Trump to that effect, the major U.S. equity benchmarks opened significantly higher Monday.Source: Shutterstock Holding those big gains was a different story as the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 closed higher by 1.06% and 0.77%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the week to the upside by 0.44%.In late trading, about two-thirds of the Dow's 30 members were higher, but that group did not include, perhaps surprisingly, all of the Dow's technology components. Technology, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, has been an epicenter for tariff talks. It is widely expected the group will rally if US-China trade hostilities ease.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPresident Trump cleared the way for Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications company, to resume purchases of products from U.S. technology firms, as long as those goods are not related to national security. Even with that news, however, Dow semiconductor name Intel (NADSAQ:INTC) closed up just 0.38% today. Trade Talk Winners in the Dow Jones TodayWhile there were some obvious disappointments today-we're looking at you, Intel-many of the Dow's best performers were names with high tariff sensitivity. Prime example: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which added 1.83% to rank as one of the Dow's best-performing components today. That's a good start to the third quarter, a period in which the iPhone maker historically delivers for investors, but some analysts are cautious.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer &quot;Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Monday reiterated his Buy rating for Apple stock, but he's becoming more cautious over the smartphone maker's app store sales in China,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Mohan cited third-party data on app store sales which implied Apple China app store sales growth went from 23% year-over-year in April, to 19% in May, and 5% in June.&quot;Another Dow winner on Monday was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which added 1.34% after an arbitrator ruled the world's largest soft drink maker can sell its own energy drink. That ruling could jeopardize Coca-Cola's partnership with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), a stock that found a way to close higher today, too.&quot;An arbitration tribunal ruled on June 28 that Coca-Cola Energy did not violate the non-compete clause in the company's contract with Monster,&quot; reports The Atlanta Business Chronicle. &quot;According to the ruling, Coke can continue to sell the drink in the markets it has already launched in and can expand to other markets as it sees fit.&quot;JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was another Dow leader today, likely a symptom of what we noted here last Friday. The bank has impressive plans to return major amounts of capital to shareholders via an increased dividend and bigger-than-expected share buyback effort.Dow (NYSE:DOW), the only chemicals name in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (and a somewhat tariff-sensitive name at that), added 1.72% today and has recently been showing some signs of life. Read an article from last week about why the stock is inexpensive and may not be that way for long. Bottom Line: Shifting Focus?Following the G-20 summit, it is important for all investors to realize what happened. Simply put, two bickering sides said they are going to talk on cordial terms. What comes of those negotiations remains to be seen. The U.S.-China relationship is one with long-term implications and the U.S. deficit with China of $420 billion (in 2018) will not be erased overnight.Trade issues with China are not put to bed, but with the trade meeting over, market participants will be looking elsewhere for catalysts. Second-quarter earnings will be one of the catalysts, but how negative or positive is yet to be determined.&quot;Heading into the end of the second quarter, 113 S&P 500 companies have issued EPS guidance for the quarter,&quot; said FactSet. &quot;Of these 113 companies, 87 have issued negative EPS guidance and 26 companies have issued positive EPS guidance. The number of companies issuing negative EPS for Q2 is above the five-year average of 74.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

1600,0.946,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. may have boosted the single, greatest risk they face -- that of tougher regulation -- by becoming early backers for Facebook Inc.’s new digital money, called Libra.That’s according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette, who wrote that the three companies face a potentially “heavy burden” as already-fierce regulatory scrutiny is likely to keep growing.“It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,” Faucette said. That may turn it into a “supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,” which means there’s probably going to an “up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally.”Mastercard and Visa face greater regulatory and political risk than technology risk, he said. As the cost of transactions fall, it will be hard to dislodge them as industry leaders -- unless there’s political or regulatory opposition. &quot;But such pushback is real,&quot; Faucette said.However, he’s still bullish on the companies, along with PayPal, as Libra isn’t yet “far enough along to dent our enthusiasm.” He also takes solace from some companies’ openness to leaving the Libra group “if opposition and process seem too daunting.”House and Senate hearings on Facebook’s digital coin, scheduled for mid-July, are “significant” for the company, and for Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and other firms, Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note.“These hearings are critical for Facebook,” he said. “There is only one chance to frame the debate. It has to set a tone at these two hearings for how Libra will benefit consumers while protecting their privacy.”That’s a hard task, as the hearings will likely be hostile and most lawmakers are likely to be skeptical. “Even lawmakers who generally support crypto are likely to see little political upside in supporting Facebook’s entry into the space,” Seiberg said.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.044,0.872,0.085,1

1602,0.924,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. jumped the most in three weeks after the U.S. and China declared a trade truce over the weekend, relieving the iPhone maker of some of the pressure its growth outlook faces in the event of a prolonged conflict.The shares gained as much as 3.3%, contributing the most to a rally that’s pushing the S&P 500 Information Technology Index toward a record high. Apple is bouncing back from a drop of as much as 18% after the latest flareup in early May. The company is particularly vulnerable to U.S.-China tensions as it is heavily dependent on the Asian nation for manufacturing as well as sales of its products.The trade truce removes “the albatross” that has been around Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s neck, and the shares could add as much as $25 as a result, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note. Based on Apple’s Friday close, such a gain would return the company’s market valuation back above $1 trillion.“With the positive step in the right direction announced between the two countries to not levy additional tariffs while negotiations continue, in essence this takes away the biggest risk on the Apple story (for now) in our opinion,” Ives wrote. He rates Apple outperform with a $235 price target.The trade issue has been a headwind for Apple given its heavy exposure to China. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, nearly 20% of its 2018 revenue came from the country, and China is also a critical part of its supply chain.Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said would hold off imposing an additional $300 billion in tariffs and the world’s two largest economies agreed to resume negotiations.“We view this as a positive development which will help Apple keep prices unchanged and will delay an immediate need to shift manufacturing and supply chain out of China,” wrote BofAML analyst Wamsi Mohan. The new tariffs “would have impacted almost all of Apple’s products, including the iPhone.” Mohan recently calculated that had the 25% tariffs been enacted, that could have reduced Apple’s earnings by about 15%.BofAML affirmed its buy rating and $230 price target on Apple shares, but warned that the company’s app store in China had showed “significant deceleration” in June.(Updates stock to market open, adds chart and additional commentary.)To contact the reporters on this story: Courtney Dentch in New York at cdentch1@bloomberg.net;Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chris Nagi at chrisnagi@bloomberg.net, Richard RichtmyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.035,0.894,0.07,1

1660,0.9888,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struck a positive tone about the US/China trade battle on Wednesday, which pleased Apple (AAPL) investors. Apple has been under the cloud of this trade war for the last few months, with much of their production and supply chain based in China. Mnuchin’s said that a US/China trade deal was “90 percent” complete, and he believes that “there’s a path to complete this” at the G20 Summit in Japan this week when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet.Last week, Apple formally displayed its displeasure with the geopolitical situation when it formally asked the US government to not accelerate its tariffs on goods made in China. They also told the US Trade Representative that the government’s actions would hurt its global competitiveness. One month ago, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that there is a 29% downside risk to Apple’s earnings due to the possibility of the US/China trade war escalating further.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that Wall Street has priced in Apple’s worst-case scenario with this trade-war, and after these positive comments he maintains his Outperform rating on the stock, with a $235 price target. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)Ives believes that continued tariffs could reduce earnings by 10% to 15% over the next few years, but the seemingly strong possibility this overhang is removed is a fantastic sign for the tech giant and its investors.How much upside does Ives foresee in the stock if everything goes well? Ives thinks that “a resolution to the China tariff situation could add between $20-$25 per share to Apple's stock over the coming months.” This is due to the margin increases from the tariff reduction for phones sold in the US, and the significant importance of the Chinese market to Apple going forward with a saturated US market that has grinded iPhone sales growth to a standstill.Overall, AAPL stock had 15 bullish analysts in its corner over the last three months, 15 analysts playing it safe on the sidelines, and only two bears who think that the valuation on Apple stock is beyond crazy. The average price target on AAPL is $212.90, representing nearly 7% upside from where the stock is currently trading.To read more on the nitty gritty of what’s going on in the tech stocks space, click here.Read more on AAPL:  * Apple (AAPL) Slowly Assembling Approach to Autonomy with Drive.ai  * Apple & Google’s Vision of the Future Contrasted by Developer Resources  * Chinese Government Setting Tone of Support Towards Apple (AAPL)  * US-China Tensions Playing Stronger Role in Apple (AAPL) Stock  More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Top 5 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 — So Far   * T-Mobile (TMUS) Enters 5G Race, but We’re Still Two Years Away   * Facebook Watch Is One to Watch   * Rally on!

1681,0.9972,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. is arguably the most consequential company of the last 50 years. It is consequential by virtue of its reach and profitability, its products and daring, its unusual place – particularly for a corporation – in the zeitgeist, its role as a catalyst for seismic social change, and its mystique as the house that the late Steve Jobs built.Apple also matters, of course, as a revolutionary design shop. Jobs was the original steward of the company’s aesthetic and its products were laced with all of the personal influences that shaped his design philosophy, including Bauhaus architecture, the Sony Corporation’s own product line, art, Zen Buddhism, and typography. Design informed everything at Jobs’ Apple, and it was tethered to a primary goal: Simplicity.“Simple can be harder than complex,” Jobs once told Businessweek. “You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”Jobs recruited a number of talented designers throughout the years with whom he shared fruitful partnerships. But it was his union with Jony Ive from 1997 until Jobs’s death in 2011 that proved to be the most momentous pairing. Together, the duo created and launched the iMac, the iPod, the iPad, the Apple Watch and that iconic disrupter, the iPhone. And Ive’s disclosure to the Financial Times on Thursday that he will resign as Apple’s design chief by the end of the year brings down the curtain – fully and finally – on the Jobs era. It’s also a moment to remember, before Ive shuffles off, not just the sleek, minimalist products produced by the Jobs-Ive partnership, but how the two men approached design.At the most basic level, Ive and Jobs were obsessed with simplicity and they thought about it as a form of perfection.“Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you,” Ive told the Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson several years ago. “Simplicity isn’t just a visual style. It’s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep… You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential.”Jobs and Ive wedded that profound product knowledge to what Ive – the British son of a silversmith who later taught design – liked to call “the idea of craft.” It was an old-fashioned, artisanal approach brought to bear on some of Silicon Valley’s most newfangled consumer products. And it was all done to bring beauty to the mass market.Ive set up what was essentially an enormous craftman’s studio inside Apple where he and his team were walled off from other employees. He and Jobs would often wander the studio alone together, fiddling with works in progress, figuring out how to make them better, how to make them simpler.&quot;When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same,” Ive once recalled of his connection to Jobs. “And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things.”After Jobs’s death, Ive took on Apple’s creative mantle alone and was given new responsibilities that made him the most pivotal person at the company, in charge of the look and function of products and with control over launch dates. Tim Cook, Jobs’s successor as chief executive, reportedly went out of his way to accommodate Ive but the Brit began showing up less regularly at the company’s headquarters and product launches. Some of his duties were shifted to others.As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Shira Ovide noted, Ive’s decision to leave Apple may be for the best. With iPhone mania plateauing, Apple needs to find new products and new sources of revenue. Most of that, she notes, will have to come from software innovations that are increasingly removed from all of that elegant hardware that Ive dreamed up. Apple, and everybody else in Silicon Valley, Ovide says, need to “move past the cult of the designer that Ive represented.”It was a worthy cult, outdated or not, and Ive intends to continue practicing his obscure arts in a new design firm he’s opening called LoveFrom. Ive told the FT that his company’s name is inspired by advice that Jobs shared with employees at an Apple meeting years ago. Great design, Ive recalled Jobs saying, is an act of love and by “making something with care, you are expressing your gratitude.”To contact the author of this story: Timothy L.

1688,0.9971,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There will be stories of palace intrigue involving Jony Ive, the Apple Inc. design chief who announced Thursday that he is planning to exit the company after more than a quarter of a century. This is a simpler tale: It was time. Apart from Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former chief executive officer, perhaps no person is more identified with Apple's rise from the cusp of bankruptcy 22 years ago to one of the most admired and successful companies in the world. Ive’s place in technology’s history is assured. He helped make computers more fun, helped put millions of songs in everyone’s pocket and helped change how people interact with technology thanks to the iPhone. But it was time. It’s time for Ive, who had been less publicly visible and perhaps less involved as well, to move on. It’s also time for Apple and the rest of the technology sector to move past the cult of the designer that Ive represented.  The future of Apple and the technology industry will be shaped by software and other technologies that don’t have to look beautiful as Ive’s designs do. The future is computing woven into anything, and it’s not intended to be noticed or adored. It’s software and internet-connected sensors that can warn a factory owner about a balky production line long before it breaks down. It’s technology that can teach someone a new language more quickly by analyzing the mistakes of millions of other language learners. It’s the ability for a computer to pilot a car with human-like decision-making. Ive was in recent years in charge of Apple’s software design as well as hardware, but software wasn’t his passion. Ive, an industrial designer, grew famous for obsessing over every smartphone curve and the precise dimensions of a desk chair. People with impeccable instincts for what is tasteful and good in physical things will still matter in the future of technology infused into everything, but they will be less supreme. They are less worthy of cult-like adoration. The future belongs to the nerds.That makes Ive's departure as an Apple employee an important milestone for the company and the industry,  but not a consequential one. Everything right with Apple is still right. Everything wrong is still wrong. For the foreseeable future, Apple remains the iPhone company. For all that changed at Apple since Tim Cook took over as CEO for Jobs in 2011, it remains Steve and Jony and Tim’s iPhone company. That’s both a blessing and a curse. Few companies have changed everything with a single product. The iPhone did that, and it made Apple, founded in 1976, rich and blessed with the resources to try to stay relevant for at least another 43 years. Apple may still be the iPhone company, but this is less and less an iPhone world. Globally, smartphone sales have stopped growing. That’s what has changed most profoundly from prior rocky patches, notably around 2013. Apple relies on a product for which demand isn’t growing, and nothing else can possibly come close to filling that hole. Pockets of smartphone promise such as India, Nigeria and Vietnam are places where Apple has limited presence and little hope. Technology now is truly global, and Apple remains profoundly parochial.Citing the more than half of Apple's revenue that comes directly from iPhone sales underplays Apple's dependence on that singular smartphone with Ive’s handiwork. The iPhone is the sun around which Apple’s current and near-future products orbit. People are far less likely to buy Apple’s wireless headphones, Apple’s streaming video subscriptions or iPhone apps if they don’t own iPhones.Apple is leaning now on these non-iPhone products for growth, but it won’t change that. The “resource curse” is the shorthand for oil-rich countries that grow dependent on fossil-fuel revenue and see their development suffer. That’s Apple. But the future cannot be Steve and Jony and Tim's iPhone company. To thrive, Apple needs to change its identity in ways that don’t come naturally. Apple is far from a leader in emerging areas such as driverless cars, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Can the company that brought you iTunes – a software so maligned and clunky that even an Apple executive made fun of it at a recent conference – really bring the world vehicles without drivers? Apple deserves kudos for carefully stage-managing the exit of Ive. When he leaves later this year, the company said Ive will head his own design firm that will have Apple as a client. Presumably sometime down the road, Ive will hang up his (very tasteful) hat for good. It’s a big moment. It also a long belated signpost of how much Apple’s hardware-obsessive heritage is becoming a relic.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1689,0.9855,"(Bloomberg) -- Jony Ive has been leaving Apple Inc. for years. When it was finally made official on Thursday, there was nevertheless hand-wringing about the company’s future.Ive led a stable, close-knit team of designers who created the slick look and feel of Apple’s hardware and software for more than two decades. At least six members of the group have left in the past three years.The departures herald a new era. The days when Apple could reliably deliver a whole new category of device -- a spare music player, a sleek tablet, an elegant smartphone -- every few years have waned. More recently, the company has focused on iterations of its existing lineup. Now, the company needs another hit, but this one will require fundamental technological innovation, not just the design genius of Ive and his team.One person close to Apple captured the anxiety of the moment: &quot;People who have been there forever don’t want to keep doing incremental updates to current products.&quot;Apple shares slipped less than 1% in extended trading. But the stock has fallen more than 10% since early October on concern about waning iPhone demand and the U.S.-China trade war. &quot;This news only adds to the current agita around the Apple story,&quot; Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.Ive was the mastermind behind the designs of the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and iPod that took Apple from the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1990’s to its status as a trillion-dollar company. When co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011, Ive became the most important person at the company, ultimately deciding what products Apple would launch, how they would function, and what they would look like.He was in charge of a roughly two-dozen person design team that included artists whose passions extended to the development of surfboards, cars, and even DJing on weekends. Many of their spouses worked as designers, too.But after the Watch launched in 2015, Ive began to shed responsibilities. Day-to-day oversight of Apple’s design team was reduced to coming to headquarters as little as twice a week, according to people familiar with the matter. They asked not to be identified discussing private details.Around that time, Ive told the New Yorker he’d become &quot;deeply, deeply tired.&quot; He said the year leading up to the Watch debut was &quot;the most difficult&quot; since he joined Apple. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and a friend of Ive’s, suggested to the New Yorker that there could be a &quot;slightly different structure that’s a little more sustainable and sustaining,” while keeping Ive at Apple.About three months later, Ive was named Apple’s Chief Design Officer, a role that shifted day-to-day responsibility of the hardware and software design teams to a pair of executives, Alan Dye and Richard Howarth. About two years later, at the end of 2017, Apple said Ive had re-assumed some of the leadership responsibilities he had previously given up.Ive still only came to the office a couple of days a week, with many meetings shifting to San Francisco, according the people familiar with the matter. That helped him avoid the long commute from his home in the Pacific Heights district of the city to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Ive sometimes met with his team at the homes of his employees, at hotels, or other venues. The design executive even set up an office and studio in San Francisco to do much of his work.Ive also traveled frequently to London, near where he was raised. He occasionally missed out on Apple product launch events, an unthinkable absence several years ago.&quot;This has been a long time in the making,&quot; according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to discuss personnel moves. &quot;He’s been at Apple over 25 years, and it’s a really taxing job. It’s been an extremely tense 25 years for him at Apple and there’s a time for everyone to slow down.&quot;Initially, not much will change, because Apple has been operating with partial input from Ive for a few years, someone close to the team said.But challenges loom. And some people familiar with Apple are already worried about the new design leadership. Now that Ive is officially leaving, longtime studio manager Evans Hankey will run the hardware design group, Apple said. Hankey is a great team leader, but Apple now lacks a true design brain on its executive team, which is a concern, a person familiar with the design team said.Hankey and Dye will report to Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. While Williams is a talented executive, some people familiar with matter believe the shift is another sign of Apple becoming more of an operations company. Apple declined to comment.&quot;The design team is made up of the most creative people, but now there is an operations barrier that wasn’t there before,&quot; one former Apple executive said. &quot;People are scared to be innovative.&quot;Ive reported to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. The designer also used to report directly to Jobs. The two would lunch together regularly and walk around Apple’s Silicon Valley campus quietly making design decisions.&quot;Most of the greatest debates at Apple happened between those two as they walked together,&quot; said Matt Rogers, the co-founder of Nest Labs who worked on iPhone and iPod software from 2007 to 2010. &quot;For the last decade, Jony’s been one of the great product leaders on the executive team. Who’s going to carry that forward?&quot;The timing of Ive’s departure coincided with the promotion of Sabih Khan to the role of senior vice president of operations. That part of Apple has become more involved in the development of products at an earlier stage, one of the people said.The next big Apple product may be augmented reality glasses. Apple’s design group is trying to turn this nascent technology into something that changes people’s everyday lives -- in the way the iPod did for music and the iPhone did for mobile handsets. While the product is still a ways off, Apple’s operations team is already involved in the process, seeking suppliers and methods of production, the people said.A new product like that needs a &quot;leap&quot; in the underlying technology, while Ive specialized more in perfecting existing technologies for the masses, according to Rogers. Some smartphones had touch screens before the iPhone, but Ive’s team made the feature a delight to use.&quot;It’s very hard to have large breakthrough hardware innovations every year. It’s more like every five or 10 years now,&quot; Rogers said.The design team is taking on this challenge without veteran members. Christopher Stringer and Daniele De Iuliis, a pair of key Ive lieutenants, kicked off the departures a few years ago, with Daniel Coster leaving to lead design at GoPro in 2016. The team lost three members in the past six months: Julian Hoenig, Rico Zorkendorfer and Miklu Silvanto.While each Apple designer specializes in specific product lines, they all contribute to each other’s products and plans. That means losing an individual designer is still a big deal, a former Apple executive said. &quot;The design studio has no secrets,&quot; this person said. &quot;They all know what each other is working on.&quot;Apple has been hiring younger designers and increasing the size of the team. Joe Tan, who founded a firm called Moreless, joined in late 2015. “The new people have more energy,&quot; a person close to Apple said.Still, the recent departures will hurt. And the cardinal sin is to flourish after you leave.Ive had a saying that went something like this, according to a person close to the design team: There are two ways of leaving Apple — the good way is you disappear and don’t make press. The bad way is you make the press. If you leave Apple and then build the Taj Mahal, we’ll chop off your hands.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.046,0.884,0.07,1

LoveFrom, his new firm, will continue to work with Apple on projects, he said in an interview with the Financial Times.“Apple will continue to benefit from Jony’s talents by working directly with him on exclusive projects, and through the ongoing work of the brilliant and passionate design team he has built,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement.Apple shares slipped less than 1% in extended trading. The stock closed at $199.74 in New York.&quot;Ive is leaving a hole in the company and is clearly irreplaceable as he has been one of the most important figures at Apple throughout the past few decades,&quot; Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to analysts. &quot;While this is a bit if a shocker to Apple and its investors we are not overly concerned as Ive will continue to work closely with Cook & Co.&quot;Ive began leading Apple’s design team in 1996, before Apple co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company as it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Over the past two decades, Ive’s designs, from the original iMac desktop computer in 1998 to the first iPod in 2001 and the iPad in 2010, have been a significant factor in Apple’s growth. In 2012, a year after becoming CEO, Cook put Ive in charge of software design as well.Ive will be replaced by existing Apple designers. Evans Hankey, vice president of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye, vice president of Human Interface Design, will report to Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, the company said.Dye and Hankey have played key leadership roles on Apple’s design team for many years. They were among executives who took over day-to-day management of the team when Ive stepped away to focus on the creation of company’s new headquarters in Cupertino, California.Williams has led the development of Apple Watch since its inception and will spend more of his time working with the design team in their studio, the company added.Separately, Apple said Sabih Khan, a 24-year company veteran, will be senior vice president of operations. In recent years, Khan has inherited more responsibility for global supply chain operations that churn out hundreds of millions of devices per year—tasks once handled by Williams. Khan runs day-to-day manufacturing of the iPhone, as well as other devices, and his team has gotten involved increasingly early in the design process.(Updates with analyst comment in second paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.003,0.902,0.095,1

1737,0.9978,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It should be obvious that a car is not a smartphone. Apple Inc. is acting as if they’re the same. It’s no secret that Apple is working on self-driving vehicle technology. Apple is among dozens of companies that have California permits to test autonomous cars on public roads. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, in his way, acknowledged the driverless transportation project in a 2017 Bloomberg Television interview. News outlets regularly report on the ups and downs of this initiative. The company this week confirmed earlier reports that it had acquired autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai.And yet Apple remains far more closed than its peers. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Inc., General Motors Co.’s Cruise and other companies working on this technology talk fairly openly about their broad ambitions for autonomous transportation, milestones in progress and issues for the industry. Apple does none of this. As far as I can tell, Cook’s discussions about Apple’s autonomous transportation project has never gone beyond the vague generalities in that Bloomberg TV interview. It’s always Apple’s tendency to keep mum about a product in development until it’s perfect and ready for a world debut. But driverless cars are not smartphones or augmented reality glasses. Emerging technologies, particularly those that have the potential to save human life and also to take lives, need an open debate and deserve a relatively transparent process — warts and all.Driverless cars have the potential to transform the nature of cities, upend a country’s workforce, impact the environment and necessitate revisions to laws and ethics. The public is not well served by Apple’s inclination against engaging on a subject of such importance. Apple may not be well served by its approach, either.The driverless car industry as a whole has not been an open book. Advocates, and some regulators, have pushed companies to disclose far more than they do about safety metrics and to collaborate with rivals to ensure better and safer progress on autonomous technology. But Apple is taking the industry’s discretion to the absurd. Soon after that Bloomberg interview, Cook reiterated to stock analysts that Apple is interested in autonomous technology and has “a large project going and are making a big investment in this.” And that’s about it. “I don’t want to go any further with that,” Cook said. He’s been similarly vague since then. By comparison, Waymo executives regularly talk about the implications of driverless car technology and its potential drawbacks. In Alphabet’s most recent earnings call, executives talked about opening a Michigan facility with dedicated autonomous vehicle production, explained Waymo’s focus on Uber-like ride services and mentioned making its in-house vehicle sensors available to outside companies. Last week, an Alphabet executive answered a shareholder’s question about how autonomous vehicles might affect tax revenue.Alphabet has progressed further with its driverless car project than Apple has, but that shouldn’t limit engagement given the way the technology is advancing. It’s growing more clear that the biggest benefit from driverless cars may not be in individually owned cars but from improving shared transportation. No single company can accomplish this in a vacuum. It requires engagement with transportation planners and researchers, input from legal experts, settling on safety benchmarks and working with suppliers. Apple may be doing some of this secretly, but that misses the point. Autonomous technology progress demands a broad coalition and open engagement with the world. For Apple investors, driverless technology is a “free optionality” for long-term stock owners, CFRA Research said this week. The costs are already being absorbed. Apple’s operating margin is at its lowest level in a decade as a share of revenue. Largely that’s because spending on research and development — which presumably includes Apple’s driverless car project — amounted to 6% of Apple’s revenue in the last 12 months. It was 3% just five years ago.It’s possible Apple is keeping mum about driverless technology because openness is not in the company’s DNA. Or maybe Apple’s laggard status in the technology explains its silence. California regulatory reports show that Apple’s autonomous test cars require more intervention by human backup drivers than many other companies’ prototypes. (There is debate about whether this data is the best measure of progress, but it’s one of the few available publicly.)Apple has the power to shape public perception in a way that maybe no other company can. It uses that power to sell smartphones, of course, but also to win people over to the company’s views of U.S. immigration policy, the importance of teaching software coding to children and the pernicious effects of social media.Driverless cars won’t be ubiquitous on public roads for many years, but policies and public perception are being set now. People in the U.S. are skeptical about driverless cars, and if nothing else, a little more engagement from Apple might help change opinion. A version of this column originally appeared in Bloomberg’s Fully Charged technology newsletter.

1750,0.9904,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re in the business of selling passenger aircraft, design flaws that might cause your planes to crash ought to be non-existent.That’s why the discovery of a second critical safety risk on Boeing Co.’s 737 Max is so alarming. Tests by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration found that flight computers could cause the plane to dive in a way that pilots struggled to correct in simulator tests, people familiar with the finding told Alan Levin and Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg News on Wednesday. The problem wasn’t connected to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, that’s been linked to 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, but could produce similar effects, one of the people said.(1)Lightning shouldn’t strike in the same place twice. Developing new aircraft is a decade-scale project, with certification by aviation regulators alone typically taking five years. By the time a plane is ready to be delivered to customers, it should have passed through such a stringent battery of tests that only once-in-a-lifetime events can cause problems.It’s bad enough that the 737 Max made it onto the market with one system that could cause uncontrolled flights to plunge into the ground. To discover a second casts a worrying light on the company’s entire safety culture.How could Boeing have allowed further problems in such critical systems to lie undisclosed?Since the 737 Max grounding, many people, including this columnist, have exhorted the company to follow the crisis-management approach taken by Johnson & Johnson in the wake of the 1982 Tylenol scandal: Put safety first and maximize transparency to convince the public that the company has nothing to hide.And yet, as my colleague Brooke Sutherland has argued, there’s precious little evidence that Boeing has done enough in terms of improving transparency, communication and oversight to get it out of the doghouse.The problem is that Boeing is a different sort of company than Johnson & Johnson. Consumers were easily able to choose another brand of painkillers if they didn’t trust Tylenol, so winning back their trust was an existential issue. The same doesn’t apply in the case of commercial aircraft, which are sold in a duopolistic market where any airline wanting to get a good price from Airbus SE has to keep Boeing in play as a potential supplier.In theory, passengers who refuse to fly on the 737 Max and find out at the departure gate that their aircraft has been switched from an A320neo could tear up their tickets and exercise consumer choice in the same way as a shopper buying headache pills. In practice, we’re all stuck with whatever is served up to us.Investors seem to know this. Boeing’s share price, amid the grounding of its key product and a simmering trade war over one of its biggest markets, is doing just fine. Blended forward 12-month price-earnings ratios put it on a higher valuation than Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Apple Inc. At the Paris airshow this month, the company managed to score a haul of around $34 billion in new orders – less than the $44 billion tally for Airbus, to be sure, but grounded on a $24 billion commitment from IAG SA for the 737 Max itself.Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg this week promised to inspire a “relentless pursuit of safety” at Boeing. “We want to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable bringing problems to the surface,” he told the Aspen Ideas Festival on Wednesday. “We don’t want to create an environment where problems stay hidden.”This latest revelation suggests that’s still not happening – and far from suffering, Boeing is doing just fine. (1) Slow processing by a cockpit chip meant that the workarounds pilots use to recover from problems with the MCAS were taking too long to kick in, according to a separate report by Aviation Week. Boeing acknowledged the issue and said it’s working on a software fix.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has fined Google billions of dollars for antitrust violations and has opened an early-stage probe into Amazon.com Inc.‘s potential use of data on smaller rivals’ sales.“I won’t mention her name but she’s actually considered to take Jean Claude’s place because Jean Claude at some point is retiring,” said Trump, referring to the possibility that Vestager could succeed European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker. “She hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I’ve ever met. What she -- what she does to our country -- she’s suing all our companies.”For More: Faltering German Hands Vestager Chance to Claim Europe’s Top Job“You know, look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, which perhaps we will, okay,” Trump said, without saying what he thinks the U.S. should sue the companies for. “They’re suing everybody, they make it very -- almost impossible to do two-way business.”Alphabet Inc.‘s Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc. shares dipped on the news before recovering. Google was down 1.2%, Facebook fell less than 1% while Twitter gained 1.4% to Wednesday afternoon in New York.Representatives for Google and Facebook didn’t comment.Social media companies have sought to more aggressively police their sites for what they consider hate speech and fraudulent accounts, but say they have no policies targeting conservatives.Trump’s threat comes after Project Veritas, a conservative organization known for deceptively edited hidden-camera videos, released footage this week allegedly depicting a Google employee saying the company wants to prevent Trump’s re-election.In a blog post, the woman from the video said the notion Google is trying to sway the election “is absolute, unadulterated nonsense.”She said she was explaining that her former team at the company “is working to help prevent the types of online foreign interference that happened in 2016.”House HearingAll three companies were scheduled to testify before a House committee Wednesday on efforts to combat terrorist content and misinformation.Representative Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee holding the hearing said he had “serious questions” about Google’s ability to be fair given the Project Veritas video.“This report, and others like it, are a stark reminder of why the founders created the First Amendment,” Rogers said in his opening statement. “We are in trouble” if the views in the video represented Google company policy.Google’s global director of information policy testified Wednesday that no single employee could skew search results based on her political beliefs.“We are in the trust business,” the executive, Derek Slater, told Rogers. “We have a long-term incentive to get that right.”Big technology companies are coming under heightened scrutiny in Washington from the government and Congress. Trump’s Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have taken the first steps toward investigating four big platforms for antitrust violations by splitting jurisdiction over them. The Justice Department has taken responsibility for Google and Apple Inc., while the FTC will oversee Facebook and Amazon.The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, led by Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, has launched a broad investigation into the nation’s biggest technology companies starting with a focus on how companies like Google and Facebook have impacted the news industry.For more: House Panel Kicks Off Antitrust Probe With Focus on News MediaSeparately, state attorneys general, including Nebraska’s Doug Peterson and Louisiana’s Jeff Landry -- both Republicans -- are advancing a broad inquiry into whether the biggest U.S. technology platforms are violating antitrust and consumer protection statutes.(Updates with additional Trump quotes in seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from David McLaughlin.To contact the reporters on this story: Alyza Sebenius in Washington at asebenius@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.097,0.813,0.09,-1

1770,0.9882,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. hired one of ARM Holdings Inc.’s top chip engineers as the iPhone maker looks to expand its own chip development to more powerful devices, including the Mac, and new categories like a headset.The company hired Mike Filippo in May for a chip architect position, according to his LinkedIn profile. At ARM, Filippo was a lead engineer behind chip designs that power the vast majority of the world’s smartphones and tablets and was leading a new push into parts for computers. ARM, owned by SoftBank Group Corp., designs microprocessors and licenses technology that is fundamental to the chip development efforts of Apple, Samsung Electronics Co., Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.Prior to his work at ARM, Filippo was also a key designer at chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. ARM confirmed Filippo’s departure. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.“Mike was a long-time valuable member of the ARM community,” a spokesman for the U.K.-based company said. “We appreciate all of his efforts and wish him well in his next endeavor.”For Apple, the hire could help fill the void left by the departure of Gerard Williams III earlier this year. Williams was Apple’s head architect of chips used in the iPhone and iPad. Apple’s A series chips power its mobile devices using ARM technology. Its Mac computers have used processors from Intel for nearly two decades.The company initiated a plan several years ago to replace Intel chips in its Mac computers with processors based on the ARM architecture as early as 2020. Filippo’s experience in more advanced chips like those in servers would assist in that effort. The company is also planning to expand its in-house chip making work to new device categories like a headset that meshes augmented and virtual reality, Bloomberg News has reported.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.0,0.883,0.117,1

1786,0.999,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I was in San Francisco last week, and most of my conversations eventually turned to the same topic: Could some other region supplant the Bay Area as America’s tech hub? San Francisco, after all, has sky-high rents and taxes — not to mention dirty streets, unpleasant strip clubs and numerous homeless. The towns of Silicon Valley are more livable than San Francisco (though rents are still high), but they are dull and not ideal for attracting highly educated young singles.I have a nomination for a potential rival for America’s main tech hub: Los Angeles. Increasingly, I am beginning to wonder whether the Bay Area’s position is truly secure.First, consider the virtues of the Los Angeles area. It has splendid weather — warmer and sunnier than San Francisco — and a deep pool of talent. It is America’s second-largest city, with many nice neighborhoods to choose from (some of them, to the east, even affordable). It even has a subway, albeit an underdeveloped one. I would argue it has much better food, and of course a much larger and more diverse entertainment scene. You might reasonably conclude that top talent might prefer to live in or near Los Angeles rather than the Bay Area.Southern California already has produced some important startups, including Snap, SpaceX and Tinder. No, they haven’t come close to the impact of Google or Facebook, but they show that a tech scene can develop. Caltech, USC and UCLA are not the equal of Stanford, but still they provide a powerful talent base, and Stanford remains not so far away.How could L.A.’s tech scene develop even further? Imagine that virtual reality is the “next big thing” and the gamification of just about everything, including education, proceeds apace. For the next generation of startups, that might throw the balance of power in the direction of expertise in entertainment and design — a sense of the theatrical, in other words, intermediated through tech. That could favor the culture of Los Angeles and Hollywood. Southern California also has a strong background in aerospace and military contracting, two areas that could produce a spillover effect for the next tech booms, especially if they involve transportation. The region also remains the leading U.S. manufacturing center, and that too could be a source of future synergies.Of course, it is unlikely that Google, Facebook or Apple would leave the Bay Area. But over some time horizon they will take on less relative importance. They may become legacy companies that cease to innovate, or they may face legal and regulatory pressures and penalties. That would open up room for Southern California to be the leader for the next generation of tech companies.One huge advantage for Southern California, compared to say New York City or Austin, Texas, is simply that it is so close to Northern California. If you want to set up meetings with Silicon Valley titans, or lure talent to move, the Los Angeles area is a pretty good base of operations in terms of proximity and ease of access.Northern California had an original advantage over Southern California as a center of free thinking and thus as a tech hub. Think back to Haight-Ashbury, the 1960s, Beatniks, LSD and the Whole Earth Catalog, the psychedelic movement, the bohemian and gay cultures of San Francisco. All of that bred an atmosphere of rebellion, and it helped birth the personal computer and a large movement of non-conformist hippie programmers, often working out of their proverbial garages.But those cultural roots have largely faded, and if anything today San Francisco and the Bay Area are better known for political correctness and a conformist culture of scolding and groupthink. That can’t be good for the region’s long-term creativity.Traffic is a big problem for Los Angeles, but the same goes for San Francisco, where it seems to get worse each year. And an underrated benefit of Southern California is that travel is usually more predictable (if slower) on the surface roads than on the freeway.  At any rate, some of L.A.’s tech companies are already clustering between LAX and Santa Monica, for (relatively) easy access to each other. You can imagine other companies moving further south or further east to enjoy different intellectual micro-climates, and perhaps for more space and cheaper rents.Oh, and did I mention that Peter Thiel moved his operations to the Los Angeles area last year? Thiel, the venture capitalist who was one of the founders of Paypal, helped to discover and mobilize Mark Zuckerberg, Reid Hofmann and Elon Musk. He was also one of the first major business leaders to recognize the importance of Donald Trump.I’m not yet sold on the idea of Los Angeles displacing the Bay Area. But I’m seeing more signs pointing in that direction.To contact the author of this story: Tyler Cowen at tcowen2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

1791,0.9267,"US government hearings on proposed new tariffs on around US$300 billion of Chinese goods came to a close on Tuesday, after seven days of testimony by hundreds of companies and industry associations seeking shelter from the costs of the countries' escalating trade war.The hearings wrapped up in Washington just days before US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are to meet in Japan on Saturday in a bid to get trade talks back on track after a six-week impasse.With the trade conflict set to pass the one-year mark on July 6, Trump has threatened to slap 25 per cent duties on the remaining untaxed Chinese goods, should the discussions go poorly.Over 300 representatives from industries that would be hit by such tariff action have testified before an inter-agency committee over the past week, while close to 3,000 additional written comments have been filed to the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) from companies including Apple, Fitbit and Keurig Dr Pepper.They said, however, that the use of tariffs is costing American jobs, raising prices for consumers and, in some cases, posing a national security risk.The committee will accept written responses and rebuttals from companies until July 2, then deliver its recommendations on possible exemptions to the USTR.The trade war has ruptured global supply chains, plunged US soybean futures to their lowest point in a decade and led to higher costs for US importers.&quot;China doesn't pay the tariffs,&quot; Nate Herman, director of government relations at the Travel Goods Association (TGA), said on Tuesday during his testimony. &quot;We do.&quot;TGA estimates that the third tranche of tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese imports cost the travel goods industry an additional US$288 million over seven months.One member company had exhausted its line of credit to pay those tariffs upon the goods' entry into the US, Herman said in an interview on the sidelines of the hearing.A fourth and final tranche, which would cover the remaining untaxed items in the travel goods sector, would &quot;only put the remaining nails in the coffin for our industry&quot;, Herman told the panel.In a recent letter to the USTR opposing the tariff action, Apple highlighted its pledge to invest US$350 billion in the US economy over five years and said tariff action on the company's products &quot;would result in a reduction of Apple's US economic contribution&quot;.In its written testimony, the company said putting tariffs on fitness trackers and smartwatches would give Chinese competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi a competitive edge in the US market.That change would place &quot;sensitive US health, location and financial data within the Chinese government's reach&quot;, said the company, whose stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange.Testifying on Tuesday, Fitbit executive vice-president Andy Missan said that absorbing the costs of more duties in the short term was out of the question.&quot;It would take many years and millions of dollars to replicate what we've found in China, which has developed over 40 years these very high precision, small form factor processes that, frankly, coupled with the labour costs, just don't exist elsewhere in the world,&quot; Missan said.US President Donald Trump talks to Apple CEO Tim Cook during a meeting of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board in May.

1794,0.9471,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Monzo has been awarded the ultimate Silicon Valley seal of approval: A $144 million fundraising round led by Y Combinator, the biggest name in startup accelerators. The deal values the British banking app at $2.5 billion, twice what it was worth in the private markets last year. It has been given a license to lose money like never before as it tries to conquer America, the El Dorado for fintech challengers.The company’s attempt to displace the old “out of touch” lenders, and to show that millennials can get as excited about their bank accounts as they do about Instagram, warrants a little skepticism though. It’s unclear how Monzo intends to make a profit or deliver decent returns to its venture capital backers in a low-margin market that’s crammed with upstart rivals and dominated still by the big banks. Regulators are a worry too.Behind Monzo’s brightly-colored debit card, slick smartphone app, and “Investival” crowdfunding events where you can swig beer and eat street food, is a business that looks pretty much like… a bank. Or rather a very tiny one. It has 2 million U.K. customers; the leading British retail lender Lloyds Banking Group Plc has 10 times as many. At the end of February, Monzo had 71.2 million pounds ($90.2 million) of customer deposits, a microdot next to Lloyds’s 400 billion pound balance sheet.Whereas most banks would seek to lend from those deposits to earn a return, Monzo doesn’t really do that. Its most recent accounts show loans making up only about 0.1% of its total assets. It has started to dabble in personal lending, but the bulk of its revenue comes from fees and commissions. Its main loan product is overdrafts, for which it charges up to 15.50 pounds a month. Otherwise, it relies on getting commissions from partner companies, which use Monzo’s app to offer their own products such as savings accounts and switching energy providers. These are cutthroat markets.Regulatory barriers add to the financial pressure: Monzo posted a loss of 30.5 million pounds in its fiscal year ended 2018. Banking license requirements pushed it to raise extra funds in 2017 and new rules are coming in all the time. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority is cracking down on overdraft charges. No wonder Monzo has started demanding fees for its premium current accounts. The perks may include “swag” like T-shirts, but 72 pounds a year is pricey.Now consider its next target, the U.S. market. A smorgasbord of cheesily-named mobile banks has been operating there for years: Simple, Chime, Varo, etc. They’ve been trying to challenge the egregiously fat fees charged by big incumbent retail banks, which is fair enough. Yet they’ve got nowhere near dislodging the top lenders. For all their flaws, the biggest banks have the most features packed into their mobile apps, according to analysts at Standard & Poor’s. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s yearly $11.4 billion tech budget could gobble up four Monzos. Is this a market that’s truly ripe for disruption?Startups do have the edge over their bigger rivals in terms of their institutional simplicity. Victor Basta of the boutique investment bank Magister Advisors reckons the compliance demands at big financial firms mean it might take them six months to match what a startup can do in six weeks. But the heft of Wall Street and Europe’s biggest lenders does give them an advantage in the true fight over finance’s future: With Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. The tech giants have the cash, scale, data and engineering smarts to make serious incursions into Main Street if they so choose.So Monzo and its ilk will probably find themselves competing with big banks and Big Tech one day. When that happens, they risk becoming roadkill – or street food.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

1797,0.8951,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ten months ago, I warned that storm clouds were brewing over the global technology industry. The situation today is much worse.Back then, a U.S.-China trade war was more risk than reality, Apple Inc.’s pending iPhone update held promise, and central banks were still in tightening mode. Yet inventories at the end of June 2018 had climbed to the highest since the financial crisis a decade earlier and a sector-wide slowdown was looming.At the time, the Pollyannas were louder than the Chicken Littles. The next iPhone had yet to launch and Christmas shopping season was coming, argued the optimists.Since then, global technology companies have issued loud warnings about lost sales due to U.S. actions against Huawei Technologies Inc. In short, because the U.S. is restricting what can be sold to the Chinese giant, the company and its suppliers are cutting orders. This is causing a ripple effect from semiconductor materials supplier IQE Plc to chip designer Broadcom Inc.But there’s something you need to know about the Huawei effect: It isn’t the cause of this technology recession. If anything, the company is the reason why the situation didn’t worsen earlier. The U.S. war on Huawei propped up the tech sector, notably semiconductors, over the past year.Let me explain. Immediately after the Trump administration in May blacklisted Huawei from buying U.S. components, Bloomberg News reported that the maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones had been been stockpiling components in anticipation of some kind of action. Chairman Ren Zhengfei saw his own storm brewing and started saving for the rainy day that came on May 17.This tells us that some proportion of global component demand over the past year wasn’t led by end-product sales, but merely by shelf-stocking. More significantly, what revenue component makers did see was probably a false signal, pointing to demand that didn’t exist.These suspicions were confirmed earlier this month when Mark Liu, chairman of made-to-order chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., told me that he wasn’t sure how much of his company's recent revenue had gone to supplying Huawei’s end-product demand versus building the Chinese company’s inventory. Almost every technology company is a client of TSMC. If Liu, who has the broadest and deepest picture of the global tech sector, can’t make out the difference between demand and inventory build, then you can be sure he’s not alone.There’s also solid data to show the scale of Huawei’s stockpiling. Total inventories climbed 33% last year. Its stash of components – measured as raw materials and works in progress – jumped 76%. At even its most optimistic, there’s no way that Huawei expected 76% revenue growth this year.Which brings us back to the sector as a whole.Here’s an update of the numbers compiled 10 months ago, based on nine leading technology hardware companies and charted by my colleague Elaine He. The results aren’t heartening:With few exceptions, inventories – measured in dollar terms or days outstanding – climbed since June 30, 2018, and were unequivocally higher than two years ago. The revenue slowdowns that have affected every corner of the hardware sector this year make this buildup ominous.Of even greater concern are data pointing to prolonged cash conversion cycles, a measure of how long companies take to turn manufactured goods into money. The only firm to see a solid dip is Apple, and that’s because it tends to generate revenue from customers before having to pay suppliers. Both TSMC and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (aka Foxconn) have said they hold inventory on their books for their key client. Were it not for that fact, Apple’s rising inventory days outstanding would probably be even higher.A major reason for Hon Hai posting weak earnings in the first quarter was inventory provisions. Those can be reversed if products sitting on shelves get sold to consumers, Hon Hai CFO David Huang told me this month. But shipping an already-made device to meet demand means you don’t need to manufacture a new phone, which in turn means no need to buy components from suppliers, and so forth.That’s the situation we’re in now: plenty of inventory, false signals from the Huawei effect, and a pending global economic slowdown that’s likely to suppress demand. If that doesn’t make make you worry about the state of global technology hardware, then I applaud your optimism. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1804,0.9954,"(Bloomberg) -- Roku Inc. shares fell on Tuesday, with the stock retreating further from record levels in what analysts said was a reaction to the company’s massive year-to-date advance.The stock dropped as much as 6.6% in what was on track to be its fourth straight decline, its longest losing streak since a six-day decline in April. Roku, a platform for video-streaming services, has lost about 12% over the four-day slump.Even with the recent losses, the stock is up nearly 250% from a December low, and it hit record levels last week.“There are plenty of examples of high-growth companies that are well positioned in popular sectors, where investors get ahead of themselves,” said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson who has a buy rating on the stock.“Roku is in a very favorable position, where it can exploit the large investments being made by participants in the video category -- not just Netflix, but also Amazon, Apple and Disney,” he told Bloomberg in a phone interview. “As video ad revenue gravitates to where the eyeballs are, to [over-the-top] services and away from legacy, linear television, I think it has the ability to grow into its valuation.”Roku’s stock has long been in a tug-of-war between its high levels of growth and a valuation that analysts often see as excessive. The stock can be extremely volatile, moving more than 20% following each of its past four quarterly results.Roku’s second-quarter results are estimated to come out on August 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Currently, analysts expect it to report revenue growth of more than 40%, a pace that’s expected to continue in the subsequent quarter, and then stay above 30% for the next two quarters.This growth is seen as fueled by the company’s continued popularity with consumers at a time when streaming video has become a dominant part of the entertainment landscape. According to a Citi analysis of over-the-top services, the Roku Channel was the seventh most popular channel in May, up from ninth place in April.“The market clearly believes Roku has nearly unlimited growth potential,” wrote Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter in a report dated June 24.He added that while the company had built “an exceptional platform” and “has positioned itself as best in class for OTT advertising,” these factors were “fully priced in” the share price.Wedbush has a neutral rating on Roku, but on Monday boosted its price target to $105 from $65.To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.017,0.846,0.137,1

1806,0.9774,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- How can investors use inexpensive index strategies yet still generate returns that outperform the markets? The solution to that particular challenge is the combination of fundamental and factor investing, according to Chris Brightman, chief investment officer and partner at Research Affiliates LL, and this week's guest on Masters in Business.Brightman notes that so-called smart beta allows for simple, transparent and inexpensive index strategies that are not market-cap weighted. He calls this a “simple, elegant way to pursue a contrarian approach” that is more akin to cap-weighted indexes than expensive active stock selection. It also has the benefit of keeping emotions out of the process of selecting and rebalancing individual equites. Bad behavior leads to an average annual underperformance of 200 basis points versus the broad indexes. By using a systematic approach to indexing, investors avoid this performance penalty.  In our conversation, we discuss the lagging performance of value stocks, and why they tend to be so cyclical. Every long-term study that looked at the value-versus-growth question historically has confirmed value eventually will outperform growth around the world. The issue is that long time line, which eventually leads investors to becoming bored and shift away from value. Brightman adds that value’s outperformance comes from some assumption of additional risk, as well as investor’s behavior.Brightman was a member of the Investment Fund for Foundations, the Virginia Retirement System, the University of Virginia Investment Management Company, and Strategic Investment Group. Previously, Brightman managed money for the University of Virginia endowment.His favorite books are here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Bloomberg, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Overcast, and Stitcher.

1836,0.9988,"(Bloomberg) -- Gone are the days of air mattresses on the floor. Airbnb Inc. is now catering to the mega-wealthy with a new tier of luxury rentals.Airbnb Luxe went live Tuesday morning after long being teased, with 2,000 new listings on Airbnb’s website offering guests the chance to stay in some of the world’s most extravagant homes. Everything from entire islands to medieval castles and mansions decked out with water slides, dinosaur skulls, and archery ranges are up for rent.The average luxury listing has an asking price of $14,000 a week—but can go as high as $1 million a week for a private atoll near Tahiti that comprises 21 bungalows and a staff of 50.Luxury travelers have been eyeing high-quality home-rentals for a while, says Nick Guezen, Airbnb’s global director of portfolio strategy. But the market hasn’t offered enough security to high-profile and mega-rich clients who seek privacy, he says. “I think that's something that was missing—the idea of ‘I want to travel to a luxury home, but I’m not sure where to find it or who to trust.’”Which is not entirely the case, considering Accor SA-owned Onefinestay, the second-home rental platform ThirdHome, and apartment-rental company Paris Perfect are all established competitors in the space. And Airbnb Luxe itself is essentially a re-branding of Luxury Retreats, a Canadian company that specializes in high-quality listings and was acquired by Airbnb in 2017 for around $300 million. None of the listings on Luxe are new to market, they just now sit under the Airbnb umbrella.The company is betting on the strength of its brand to give it the competitive edge. “People are growing up with Airbnb,” said Eshan Ponnadurai, global marketing director of luxury for Airbnb. “Someone that started in their early 20s renting a room at $100 a night and is now growing in affluence may want a room at $1,000 a night.”Because Airbnb has become part of the cultural dialogue, renting out your home to a stranger has become legitimized in a sociological sense as well—even to the super-rich, says New York University Professor Arun Sundararajan, an expert on the sharing economy. In the past, those who own multimillion dollar properties might have been reticent to share them with strangers, but today most people know someone who has stayed in an Aribnb, he says. “It feels like a more normal activity and that lowers the barriers to rent out a more expensive home.”In 2017, only 36 percent of affluent travelers (those with an income over $100,000) surveyed by Skift Research reported to staying in alternative accommodation or home rentals. This year that number has mushroomed to 59 percent. Luxury LegitimacySince its founding in 2008, Airbnb has upended the travel industry, challenging the big hotel chains and travel sites like Booking Holdings Inc. while also attracting the ire of cities around the world that are seeking to crack down on illegal listings and grappling with rising rents. Conquering the luxury rental market will allow Airbnb to sell itself as a company that can not only comply with official rules, but also cater to the world’s richest—and most demanding— travelers. “This is a way for a luxury traveler to book a home without any worries or hassle,” Guezen says. “We can give them something that is vetted and can be trusted.”In April, it took over 10 floors of New York’s 75 Rockefeller Plaza with plans to convert them into 200 overnight apartment-style suites. In May, Airbnb added high-profile luxury retail executive Angela Ahrendts to its board of directors. Ahrendts, 58, spent five years overhauling Apple Inc.’s retail operations and, prior to that, transformed Burberry into a global luxury brand. This new luxury tier represents a lucrative revenue source as well, even if Luxe’s 2,000 listings pale in proportion to the more than 6 million listings available on the general site. The company takes a percentage of the cost of each booking it arranges, so more-expensive inventory generates higher margins and helps justify the privately held company’s $31 billion valuation. Under Airbnb Luxe, the entire fee is coming from the host and the percentage depends on the market and the type of partnership arranged with homeowners, Guezen says, but declines to give any specifics as the fees vary too much between properties. The global luxury travel market is worth more than $200 billion, and analysts expect it to continue growing.Trip DesignersThe biggest difference booking under Luxe vs. Airbnb’s regular or higher-tier Plus listings is free access to a trip designer, who arranges check-in logistics, local bespoke experiences, and services from childcare to private chefs or in-house massage therapists. (While novel for Airbnb, this sort of high-touch service, similar to that provided by Onefinestay’s dedicated concierges, is standard in super-high-end home rentals.)Airbnb’s 20 trip designers will be available to guests around-the-clock for VIP support. Some have already handled bizarre requests during Luxe’s pilot phase, such as building a temporary basketball court in Los Cabos, Mexico, for an NBA player or cordoning off a section of a jungle in Tulum for a high-profile family to cave dive in private. Homeowners or their representatives must apply to be part of Luxe. Each property is reviewed by an internal team that runs through a 300-point check list scrutinizing everything from the home’s design qualities and architecture to the quality of its linen and the water pressure in its showers. Listings include the Fleming Villa in Jamaica where Ian Fleming penned his James Bond novels and a medieval castle in the Tuscan countryside with nearly 100 acres of land for hiking and harvesting local produce. Many of the homes are owned by megawealthy families, including billionaires and celebrities, Guezen says. Some own multiple properties around the world and rent up to half a dozen through the site, he says. In order to protect the host’s privacy, guests are never told who owns the property and each home is stripped of anything that could personally identify them, like a bedside photograph or snail mail. Staff are advised not to disclose the identity of hosts or guests and each property is insured by Airbnb’s standard $1 million guarantee to cover any damages. Guezen says these super-rich hosts rent out their vacation retreats not only to monetize their assets, but also to ensure that the properties are well-oiled for their own stays. The move into luxury rentals is the next step in Airbnb’s plan to diversify its business ahead of an initial public offering likely next year. The company has been working toward becoming an end-to-end travel platform that can one day help travelers book flights through the site. Earlier this month it expanded its Experiences platform to include adventure tourism, offering travelers the chance to search for UFOs in Arizona or track lions on foot with Samburu guides in Kenya.Airbnb says the launch of Luxe helps meet increasing demand for luxury properties. In 2018, the number of Airbnb bookings for listings worth at least $1,000 a night increased by more than 60 percent, according to the company. “Today’s luxury traveler is craving more than just high-end accommodations,” Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said in a statement. “They seek transformation and experiences that leave them feeling more connected to each other and to their destination.” Example Luxe ListingsCaribbean Literary HavenYou can book a stay at the Fleming Villa in Orcabessa, Jamaica, where Ian Fleming found inspiration for his James Bond novels.

1837,0.9896,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At a meeting last week of Alphabet Inc. stockholders, a man lobbed a simple query at the company’s chairman: Where is the CEO? Good question.He was told that Larry Page, the head of Google’s parent company and its co-founder, wasn’t able to to come to the annual session with shareholders, who asked tricky questions about the company’s approach to artificial intelligence ethics, treatment of its contract workers and its impact on Bay Area home prices. Page wasn’t at last year’s annual meeting, either.  The stockholder sessions aren’t Page’s only glaring absence. It was news when Page and the company’s other founder, Sergey Brin, recently broke an unusually long attendance lapse at the traditional weekly Q&A for employees. U.S. lawmakers last year criticized Page for declining to appear at a hearing about exploitation of internet platforms. The senators’ outrage was a stunt, but they weren’t wrong to ask the same question as the Alphabet shareholder: Where is Larry Page?Page has always been an idiosyncratic executive. Both before and after he became CEO eight years ago, Page tended to focus on product strategy and ceded policy matters, budget-setting, shareholder outreach and many day-to-day functions to others. That role was formalized with the 2015 creation of the Alphabet structure and the installation of operating CEOs under Page — principally Google leader Sundar Pichai.The arrangement might have been a good idea at the time. But a storm is raging in Silicon Valley, and technology superpowers require accountable, visible and empowered leaders to advocate for their companies and assess the wider impact of their products. Instead, Alphabet has both a functional CEO in Pichai and a figurehead CEO who busies himself with far-off technology and is otherwise increasingly a ghost inside and outside of the company.Pichai is a capable leader of Alphabet’s only relevant business segment. But as long as the status quo continues, there will always be that niggling question: What does Larry think? Where is he? Page tended to shun the executive tasks he didn’t like, but he wasn’t always so hands-off. In early 2011, Page retook the CEO post he had given up in Google’s early years to Eric Schmidt, the hired hand and “adult supervision” for the young Page and Brin. For a while, Page was an active CEO, meeting with underlings and openly discussing efforts to slim bureaucracy and make Google operate more like a startup.Over time and particularly after the 2015 debut of Alphabet, Page’s official duties seem to have narrowed to a pinprick. Maybe it was a conscious decision to give Pichai more authority. Maybe Page was limited by his voice — vocal cord damage had reduced the volume of his speaking voice. Maybe Page grew reliant on Schmidt, who until he stepped down as executive chairman in early 2018 handled policy issues and other public duties. Whatever the reason, Page has been less actively involved as the personal and professional demands have increased for the other CEOs of U.S. technology superpowers. Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg has become extremely practiced at apologizing. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc., had his personal life splashed in tabloid pages. Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook is at the White House so often he should have a West Wing frequent visitor card. Pichai is not the titular boss but has to do all the duties of one.(1) This is probably not what any of them imagined the job would be.I’m sure Page continues to do what needs to be done. John Hennessy, the Alphabet chairman, said at the stockholder gathering that Page attends every board meeting and meets frequently with him and other directors. At an event last fall, Pichai said that Page is very involved and that the Alphabet structure of a big-picture CEO with operating executives has worked as intended.Page’s role is to ponder future technologies, someone who pushes Alphabet to make big bets and scout promising talent. That’s essential to keep a technology company relevant. But does Page need to be the CEO of the world's fourth-largest public company to play this role? And Page seems to want to have it both ways. He wants the power of a CEO to be able to award on his own a $150 million stock payout to an executive under investigation for sexual harassment, according to a lawsuit, but he doesn’t want the responsibility of a CEO to show up in front of sometimes unhappy employees at regular meetings, to face questions from annoyed shareholders or to absorb verbal blows from members of Congress. (Alphabet has disputed the lawsuit’s characterization of Page’s role in the stock award.) As the technology industry faces growing government scrutiny, this may not be the time for a visionary, chimerical CEO. Everyone would like to do only the interesting parts of a job and skip the unpleasant or dull tasks. That’s not how adult life works, and that isn't how a public company should work, either. (1) It's a pop psychology explanation, but I wonder if the structure unwittingly removes some authority from Pichai. At the stockholder meeting last week, Pichai sat oddly silent for more than 20 minutes while others tackled sometimes angry questions about matters such as Google's driverless car project, the company's approach to ethics in artificial intelligence and compensation for the company's army of contract workers. Pichai may not have the temperament to graciously interact with irked shareholders and employees, or pal around with Washington power brokers as Schmidt did. Or maybe Pichai has a little less swagger because he is ultimately not the boss.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1839,0.9825,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It was dubbed “Project After”: A secret emergency plan for the U.K.’s Conservative government to pull all of the economic levers at its disposal if Britain crashed out of the European Union without a deal. The ingredients included slashing taxes to woo multinationals, cutting trade tariffs, and boosting investment. The FT’s report of its existence in February didn’t come as a huge shock, given the U.K.’s public ambition to have the lowest business tax rate in the G20. But it was a sign of what Europe would have to contend with in the worst-case scenario: A race to the bottom on corporate tax with its neighbor.It now looks like the Tories’ Brexit Doomsday plan is becoming the official policy of the two contenders to replace Theresa May as prime minister. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both dangled tax cuts at the weekend as they prepared the country for life after the EU, whether through a negotiated withdrawal or a no-deal Brexit. Hunt called for a reduction in British corporation tax to “Irish levels” (12.5% currently) to land an “economic jumbo jet on Europe’s doorstep.” Johnson, deflecting questions about his turbulent private life, said he would “turbocharge” the economy with cuts to business and income taxes.This may of course just be cheap talk on the campaign trail. Tax cuts would be financially and politically difficult. The Resolution Foundation’s Torsten Bell estimates Hunt’s plan would cost the exchequer in the region of 13 billion pounds ($16.6 billion), while Johnson’s would cost about 10 billion pounds. The idea that the shortfall would be more than made up by companies and wealthy investors flocking to the U.K., especially in a no-deal scenario where the trading relationship with the EU is unresolved, looks very confident indeed. That longed-for jumbo jet might end up looking more like a single-propeller Cessna.Still, the increasingly reckless political climate in Britain means Europe will be paying careful attention. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is open to closer ties with the Conservatives to ensure a no-deal Brexit, an eventuality that is winning increasing support from Brits. The “Singapore-on-Thames” low-tax, low-regulation model still seems to be very much on the table: Even Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority is hinting at deregulation.The problem for the EU isn’t so much the overall corporate tax rate itself, but what else might accompany any cut. What if the U.K. engages in the kind of individual sweetheart deals that the EU doesn’t usually allow? Brussels has already accused Britain of offering some multinationals an “unjustified exemption” from anti-tax avoidance rules. Imagine a supercharged version of this, like the effective tax rate of 0.005% enjoyed by Apple Inc. in Ireland in 2014 (slapped down as illegal by the EU).A buccaneering Britain would certainly create new tensions within the EU about how best to respond. A 2018 Ifo Institute working paper, modeling the effects of a country moving from harmonized taxes to competing with its neighbors, predicted that the pressure wouldn’t be felt equally. Low-tax jurisdictions would suffer more than high-tax jurisdictions from tax competition. It’s easy to see how Ireland’s economy, where foreign-owned companies pay more than three-quarters of total corporation tax, would be vulnerable to a Britain trying to grab some of those corporate headquarters.Whether it’s Johnson or Hunt who becomes prime minister and launches the inevitable whistle-stop tour of Europe’s capitals to push for fresh Brexit concessions, the U.K.’s commitment to fair taxation and fighting fraud should be part of the negotiations. Britain’s foot-dragging on transparency at its Crown Dependencies is one reason to be worried. Trust will be a big part of any future trade relationship, and Brussels should insist that the “jumbo jet” stays in the hangar.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

1840,0.9976,"(Bloomberg) -- K-pop sensation BTS has racked up a string of firsts over an astonishing six-year run. Now the seven-member group star in their very own smartphone game, marrying two of South Korea’s hottest exports.Netmarble Corp., the country’s biggest mobile-app publisher, has unveiled a game featuring global K-Pop phenom BTS, the latest attempt to wed the country’s tech and entertainment industries to drive economic growth.“BTS World” contains previously undisclosed videos and photos of the boy band. The game takes players to their pre-debut days to recruit and train the singers. Users can pay to quicken the process of guiding the seven young men to stardom. Created by local developer Takeone Company Corp. and published by Netmarble, the game also features video and text chats with BTS members based on pre-written scripts.It’s the first major mobile title to focus exclusively on a K-Pop group, a testament to the rapidly growing clout of two of Korea’s most promising exports -- games and K-Pop -- as Hyundai cars struggle to regain momentum and Samsung semiconductors undergo an industry downturn.BTS or Bangtan Sonyeondan, which translates as Bulletproof Boy Scouts, has amassed millions of fans around the world thanks in large part to social media. The band’s Love Yourself campaign, which calls on people to take better care of themselves and encourages them to speak out on social issues, has resonated in particular with young fans.“Managing BTS myself would make me feel closer to the members,” said Paik Ji-min, a 29-year-old South Korean fan who flew to London to attend a BTS concert and said she would be willing to spend about 50,000 won (around $43) playing the game. “Just the thought of it makes me smile ear to ear.”Netmarble already plans a sequel to BTS World, seeking to maximize profit from what has arguably become the biggest K-Pop success after singer Psy. BTS has 20 million followers on Twitter and has made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show. This year, the band sold out London’s 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium in just 90 minutes.The company’s founder, Bang Jun-hyuk, teamed up with relative Bang Si-hyuk of Big Hit Entertainment, the agency behind BTS, to develop the game. The entrepreneur is betting the recipe will re-energize growth at Netmarble, which trades about 20% lower than when it listed in 2017.“Even though it’s based on story-telling, as you progress you can discover a lot of missions and gaming elements,” Seungwon Lee, Netmarble’s chief global officer, told Bloomberg Television. “It’s sufficient incentive to keep motivating users to play.”BTS creator Bang Si-hyuk, who is also known as Hitman, told Bloomberg in 2017 that the company was diversifying into intellectual property-protected content that could possibly multiply its revenue. Big Hit is now worth an estimated $2 billion, according to the Hyundai Research Institute. The company is drawing on the popularity of the band to collaborate with Line Corp. for character merchandise and Mattel Inc. for dolls. The K-pop industry is worth about $5 billion, according to the government-affiliated Korea Creative Content Agency.Read More: High School Dropout Turns Billionaire on Games Firm IPONetmarble, whose titles include Lineage 2 Revolution and Marvel Future Fight, ranked 5th among publishers of Google Play and Apple iOS apps last year in terms of revenue, according to analytics firm App Annie. Founded in 2000, the Seoul-based company has drawn backing from Chinese giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and South Korean conglomerate CJ Group.Vey-Sern Ling, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said it may be relatively easy to generate money from players because they’re already fans who display a strong willingness to pay for BTS content. But the lifespan of the game could be limited. “Once the content is consumed there should be very little reason to play on, just like how you wouldn’t watch the same movie multiple times,” Ling said.Read More: ‘Hitman’ Worth $770 Million With K-Pop Craze Rocking the PlanetTo contact the reporters on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.net;Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.021,0.844,0.136,1

1846,0.9612,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is significantly increasing its footprint in Seattle as its expands on a previously announced plan to boost hiring, bringing an additional 2,000 jobs to the area in the next five years.The iPhone maker signed a lease for office space at 333 Dexter, a 660,000-square-foot (61,300-square-meter) development in the South Lake Union neighborhood being built by Kilroy Realty Corp., according to the office of Mayor Jenny Durkan.“These new jobs confirm what we already knew: We have the best talent and city anywhere,” Durkan said in an emailed statement. “Apple’s expanded footprint in Seattle is another example of the growing opportunity that exists for residents of Seattle and the economic powerhouse our city has become.”For years, cranes have dotted the Seattle skyline as builders rushed to accommodate a swelling population and rapidly growing tech firms, led by Amazon.com Inc. That company now employs more than 45,000 at its headquarters in town and occupies about a fifth of the city’s prime office real estate. Other firms have been muscling in to recruit from Seattle’s deep well of engineers. Both Google and Facebook Inc. are leasing offices near 333 Dexter.Apple has a relatively modest presence in the city of about 500 employees. In December, the company said that it planned to add 1,000 jobs in the area over three years as part of a national expansion that also includes spending $1 billion on a new campus in Austin, Texas.To contact the reporter on this story: Noah Buhayar in Seattle at nbuhayar@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net, Dan Reichl, David ScheerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.013,0.893,0.094,1

1855,0.9965,"(Bloomberg) -- The studio that brought you “The Hunger Games,’’ “Mad Men’’ and “John Wick’’ is now facing its own existential question.Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. has lost more than half its market value over the last year as the once-idolized filmmaker struggles to find new megahits. On top of that, recent mergers have created entertainment behemoths that threaten to make smaller studios an afterthought in Hollywood’s new blockbuster environment.All that has created a new sense of urgency around the 22-year-old Lions Gate as it weighs its future: open itself to being acquired, sell off pieces, or try to bulk up to compete with the giants.“Some studios have scale and unfortunately some studios are now subscale,” said John Tinker, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. “The question is obviously, if you are a smaller studio and you do not own Marvel, what are you going to do?”Investors are worried and frustrated that management may have missed the M&A boat, said Geetha Ranganathan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Time and options seem to be running out.”Lions Gate shares fell as much as 5.3% Monday to a seven-year low of $11.38 in New York. The company declined to comment.The studio was formed in 1997 in Vancouver by movie-loving mining financier Frank Giustra. It made its name distributing R-rated movies like “American Psycho” and, with the acquisition of Summit Entertainment in 2012, was propelled into the big leagues by the teen-vampire “Twilight” film saga. That same year it also launched the “The Hunger Games’’ franchise. (The studio announced last week there might be a prequel.)But as a smaller company, Lions Gate has long been a target of merger speculation. Companies from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to Sony to CBS Corp. have been linked to potential deals. Two years ago, Lions Gate walked away from talks with game-maker Hasbro Inc. involving a $41 a share offer, worth almost $9 billion, people familiar with the situation said.Today, the stock trades below $12, weighed down by two years of declining revenue in its motion picture division, and merger talks have picked up again. Lions Gate has held informal discussions in the past year with companies that may be interested in buying the whole business, people with knowledge of the situation said. But with the stock at seven-year lows, the studio isn’t interested in selling itself at the moment, people close to the situation said.A handful of other strategies are under discussion. One is to buy a stake in Miramax, the film producer formerly owned by the Weinstein brothers, one of the people said. Its current owner, BeIn Media Group, has recently sought buyers for a minority stake. Such a move would give Lions Gate access to a library of Oscar-winning movies such as “Shakespeare in Love” and, more recently, revived franchises like “Halloween.” A Miramax spokesman declined to comment.Starz SaleThe company is also considering selling the studio’s pay-cable network Starz, which contributes more than half its profits. Lions Gate last month turned down a $5 billion informal bid from CBS for Starz, but a sale remains a possibility, according to people familiar with the situation. If that happens, industry sources say, a slimmed-down Lions Gate might become more attractive to potential bidders. Others suggest the studio would be a tough sell without Starz.Meanwhile, the studio is looking to raise perhaps several hundred million dollars from investors to expand Starz internationally. That effort will be slowed down by upcoming negotiations with AT&T’s DirecTV over fees to carry the channel.At recent stock prices, Lions Gate is valued at less than the sum of its parts, according to Tim Nollen, a Macquarie Capital analyst. Shares could be worth $21 in a breakup, with a $5 billion valuation for Starz, $1.5 billion for the motion picture unit and $1 billion for the TV segment.Malone StakeFor investors such as cable magnate John Malone, who first bought shares in 2015 at around $30, it’s a rare miss. He controls about 8% of Class A shares. Hedge fund manager Mark Rachesky, Lions Gate’s chairman, is the biggest investor with a 19% Class A stake. He has owned shares since 2004 and backed the studio in fighting off a takeover by Carl Icahn in 2010.A spokeswoman for Malone did not return requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Rachesky declined to comment.Trends sweeping Hollywood will only make it more difficult for Lions Gate to remain independent. The merging of Disney and Fox’s film companies, and AT&T and Time Warner Inc., along with Comcast’s Universal Pictures, has created a trio of studios that own and produce well-known blockbuster movie franchises, such as the Marvel superhero universe and DC Comics. The result is a small group of big films increasingly dominating the box office.Netflix ProductionMoreover, buyers for Lions Gate’s typically mid-budget fare may be shrinking. Disney and WarnerMedia are investing billions in making their own shows to lure subscribers to new streaming services. Netflix Inc., too, is producing more and more of its original content in-house, a big change from the early days when Lions Gate’s “Orange Is the New Black’’ helped make the streaming channel required viewing. That trend could lessen demand for TV programs and films made by independent studios.Lions Gate has had some successes lately. “John Wick: Chapter 3--Parabellum” helped lift it to fourth in the box office this year, ahead of competitors like Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. And the studio is still finding buyers for its shows, recently selling to HBO, NBC and even streaming platforms run by WarnerMedia and Apple Inc.Jim Gianopulos, chief executive officer of one of the smaller shops, Paramount Studios, said that appealing programming will ultimately win out regardless of production size. “Scale has its virtues, but the creative process is independent of it,” Gianopulos said in an interview.But some analysts aren’t so confident.“For the longest time, people thought the studios would come out as the winners because they own the content,” Ranganathan said. But in the wake of the mergers, “You need established franchises. If you don’t have scale, you can’t compete.”(Updates with analyst’s comment in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Anousha Sakoui in Los Angeles at asakoui@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Larry ReibsteinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.032,0.876,0.092,1

1869,-0.8902,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. faces another European Union antitrust fine a year after being ordered to pay 997 million-euro ($1.13 billion) penalty for thwarting rival suppliers to Apple Inc., according to three people familiar with the latest case.The chip giant may be fined as soon as next month, said the people, who asked not to be named because the process isn’t public. That would make it the last U.S. technology firm to get a large antitrust penalty from Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.Vestager is due to step down later this year after punishing Google with more than $9 billion in fines and ordering Apple to pay more than 14 billion euros in back taxes. She warned in May she was “definitely not done yet” with big tech as she weighs potential new probes into Amazon.com Inc., Google and Apple.The EU’s current Qualcomm investigation targets 3G chips for internet mobile dongles sold between 2009 and 2011. Regulators allege these were sold below cost in order to push Icera, now owned by Nvidia Corp., out of the market. The EU took the unusual move of sending an extra antitrust complaint to Qualcomm last year to bolster its arguments of a “price-cost” test it used to show how far below cost the prices were.Qualcomm and the European Commission declined to comment on the fine. The timing of the penalty could slip beyond the EU’s August summer break, one of the people said.Last year Qualcomm was handed the EU’s fifth-largest antitrust penalty over payments to Apple that the EU said were an illegal ploy to ensure only its chips were used in iPhones and iPads. Qualcomm is challenging the fine at the EU courts.Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is unique among semiconductor makers in that it gets most of its profit from licensing patents.

1874,0.9963,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The internet was supposed to render geography irrelevant.(2) But the corporations that dominate the internet have turned out to be remarkably concentrated, geographically speaking. In internet publishing and web search portals, a somewhat ungainly but very important North American Industry Classification System category, 58% of all U.S. jobs in December could be found in just five counties, and more than 70% in the top 10.The location quotient is a measure of how concentrated an industry is in a particular place — a quotient of 1 means it’s right at the national average — and the location quotients in the above table make clear that this particular industry is heavily concentrated in the top five counties, especially the three bordering San Francisco Bay. In San Mateo County, home of Facebook Inc., one is about 30 times more likely to encounter an internet publishing and web search portal employee than in the country in general. Just to the south in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley and the home of Google and its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., it’s 27 times more likely. Just to the north in San Francisco County, home of Twitter Inc. and Pinterest Inc., it’s 13 times more likely. The Bureau of Labor Statistics actually didn’t release fourth-quarter San Mateo County data for the sector, presumably because it was so dominated by Facebook that this would amount to disclosing private information, so I backed out the numbers using metropolitan-area data and a little elbow grease. The BLS did release San Mateo County numbers for the third quarter, and the employment total and location quotient were close to those I came up with (the average weekly wage was higher, at $8,872), so I don’t think this was much of a stretch.Related: Where Microbrewery Jobs Are OverflowingFinancial Jobs Aren’t Just in New YorkA Booming Local Health-Care Industry Isn’t Always a Good ThingEmployment location quotients of 30 and 27 are, it should be stressed, quite high, especially for such populous counties (San Mateo County has about 770,000 inhabitants; Santa Clara County nearly 2 million). Wayne County, Michigan, the headquarters of the U.S. automobile industry, had a December employment location quotient for motor vehicle manufacturing of 16.7; the District of Columbia’s location quotient for federal government employment was 13 and change.Santa Clara County did have a dizzying December location quotient of almost 64 for electronic computer manufacturing (thanks mainly, one assumes, to Cupertino-based Apple Inc.) and 40 for semiconductor machinery manufacturing (industry leader Applied Materials Inc. is based in the city of Santa Clara), but those are at least industries that revolve around creating complex, tangible products, which it stands to reason necessitates lots of people working in the same place. The internet is on first impression different: It’s everywhere, and it can be worked on from anywhere. Yet employment at the corporations that shape it is concentrated in a handful of places in the U.S. and has been getting more so. In March 2014, the top five counties accounted for 48% of the nation’s internet publishing and web search portal jobs, and the top 10 62%.Facebook and Google have been expanding overseas, so it’s possible that this focus on U.S. data is somewhat misleading — sadly there’s no global counterpart to the hyper-detailed Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages from which the data in this column (as well as pieces over the past few days on breweries, financial services and health care) is taken. Also, it’s not all about engineers at Facebook and Google: As the lower average wages outside of Silicon Valley indicate, this category also includes journalists working at online enterprises such as BuzzFeed Inc. and Vox Media Inc. in New York and elsewhere. It may also include contract workers slowly going crazy moderating Facebook pages in Phoenix; it’s often hard to know for sure how specific corporate activities are classified by the BLS, because the BLS isn’t allowed to say, but the goal is to assign the people working at a location to the industry sector that best fits what most of them are working on.Traditional media has a tendency toward concentration, too: Los Angeles County has 27% of the nation’s jobs in motion picture and sound recording industries. New York County (aka Manhattan) has 18% of all U.S. periodicals publishing jobs. The two counties together account for 20% of broadcasting employment. But the top-five and top-10 counties’ shares of jobs in these sectors are much smaller than with internet publishing and web search portals, and in motion pictures and periodicals, the very top counties have actually been losing employment share in recent years as media companies shift production to less expensive locales.In their much-cited 2009 review of what drives economic activity and the resulting wealth to “agglomerate” in certain cities, economists Edward Glaeser and Joshua Gottlieb wrote that:The largest body of evidence supports the view that cities succeed by spurring the transfer of information. Skilled industries are more likely to locate in urban areas and skills predict urban success. Workers have steeper age-earnings profiles in cities and city-level human capital strongly predicts income. It is possible that these effects will be reduced by ongoing improvements in information technology, but that is not certain and has not happened yet.It’s presumably the value of this transfer of information among skilled workers that has driven internet companies to concentrate in a few places. High costs in those places and those “ongoing improvements in information technology” might drive dispersion, although there’s no sign of that yet in this data. Politics might, too: As Facebook in particular has been discovering lately, having your employees concentrated in a few places can mean having few friends in Washington. But for now, the work of internet publishing and web search portals remains tightly clustered along the San Francisco Bay, and to a lesser extent the Hudson River and Puget Sound. Geography still seems to matter, a lot.Coming Tuesday: the sectors with the highest location quotients.(1) I realize that this has become something of a straw man, and that by this point far more has been written attacking the idea that the internet renders geography irrelevant than espousing it. But as someone who was at least halfway paying attention in the 1990s, I think it's fair to say that most people in those days assumed that universal connectivity would lead to a spreading out of economic activity rather than a concentration.To contact the author of this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brooke Sample at bsample1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

1879,0.9619,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carrefour SA, Europe's largest retailer,  may be the latest Western company to pull back from China. It’s unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the hypermarket operator said it would sell 80% of its China business for 4.8 billion yuan ($699 million) in cash to Suning.com, the Chinese retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Carrefour will retain a 20% stake. Over the past few years, the French company’s plans to shrink its China footprint has been one of the worst-kept secrets in banking. Though Carrefour sold the business pretty cheaply – with a valuation of 0.2 times 2018 sales, compared with the industry average of 0.84, according to Citigroup Inc. – loosening its ties to the mainland may be a smart move, whatever the price. With sales in the country flagging and losses piling up, the deal comes as China’s macroeconomic picture is also darkening.Yet the key challenge for Carrefour preceded the trade war. In recent years, online-only players such as Alibaba have been piling pressure on brick-and-mortar operations, with Tesco Plc, Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer Plc each announcing plans to pull back from the mainland market. Carrefour’s share of the country’s hypermarket segment fell to 4.6% last year from 8.2% in 2009, Citi writes.(1)   That’s a problem in a country with one of the world’s biggest rates of e-commerce penetration. China's online retail sales reached 3.86 trillion yuan in the first five months of this year, accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total purchases of consumer goods, according to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. To make matters worse, foreign brands no longer have the cachet they once enjoyed – at least in low-end consumer goods. In a survey last year, Credit Suisse AG said that Chinese consumers preferred domestic purveyors in categories like food and drinks and home appliances. With the trade war whipping up nationalist fervor, that trend may accelerate: The bank's latest poll of shoppers 18 to 29 years old showed that 41% preferred phones made by Huawei Technologies Co., up from 28%, while interest for Apple Inc.’s products fell to 28% from 40%.For many firms, ceding control to a local partner is probably the best way forward. Carrefour appears to be borrowing a page from the playbook of McDonald’s Corp., which sold 80% of its China business in 2017 to a tie-up between state giant Citic Group Corp. and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP.Or consider Walmart Inc., which sold its e-commerce delivery site to JD.com Inc. in 2016 in exchange for a stake in the Chinese retailer. The U.S. firm now aims to open 40 of its Sam’s Club stores in China by 2020. Costco Wholesale Corp. is also betting on China’s appetite for bulk buying, with plans to open its first bricks-and-mortar store in August. Whether Costco can pull this off without a local partner remains unclear.What is clear is that Carrefour won’t be the last retailer to rethink its China strategy. Germany's Metro AG is also looking to sell its $1.5 billion Chinese business. At a time when Chinese acquisitions overseas have dried up, bankers at least can thank Western firms for managing to drum up some business from the mainland. (1) The bank citesEuromonitor International research.To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

1880,0.9678,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks might be happy to stay away from Facebook Inc.’s push into cryptocurrencies. For now.The Libra Association, the governing body for the coin, is in talks with lenders around the world to join its ranks. Banks are mostly keeping their distance after seeing tepid consumer reaction to digital wallets such as Apple Pay and regulatory scrutiny of digital currencies.“If Facebook is able to create mass adoption on this platform, then banks will want in,” David Donovan, who leads the global financial-services consulting practice at Publicis Sapient, said in a phone interview. “There’s a business decision they have to make. Facebook is saying the market is not being served well.”Banks were absent when Facebook announced Libra last week, saying that more than two dozen other companies, including payment networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., joined the project. The social-media giant said Libra will be backed by fiat currencies to provide payment services to the 1.7 billion people worldwide without easy access to banking.Facebook and its 2.4 billion active users are hard for the largest U.S. banks to ignore -- and Citigroup Inc.’s Michael Corbat has said his firm would consider joining Libra if asked. But it’s not the first time a technology giant promised sweeping changes to the payments world.Apple Inc. introduced Apple Pay in 2014 to much fanfare. Banks spent millions promoting the service and created card rewards tied to customer use of the product. In a sign of how eager they were, banks even gave Apple a cut of the coveted interchange fees they earn from each swipe of a card.But five years in, Apple Pay has struggled to take off. Large retailers including Walmart Inc. have been hesitant to accept the technology. And while consumers spent roughly $3 trillion using digital wallets in 2018, almost two-thirds of that spending occurred in China where apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate commerce, according to a report from Juniper Research.“Advanced payment methods haven’t really taken hold unless they’re mandated,” Tim Spenny, a senior vice president at market researcher Magid who has consulted for Facebook and Visa, said in an interview. For him, the question is: “What is the use case or what is the pain point that would cause people to say ‘Hey, I’m going to put money into a cryptocurrency to start paying for things.’”After years spent trying to promote Apple Pay, U.S. banks turned their attention to tap-to-pay cards, which use the same technology while keeping the familiar card product. It’s a recipe that’s worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co. customers.“There’s a big segment that never used mobile wallets, but the moment they got their contactless cards, they’re starting to tap right away,” Abeer Bhatia, president of card marketing, pricing and innovation for the bank, said in an interview last month. “When they have the choice to use either, they’re overwhelmingly using tap-to-pay.”Banks have been conducting their own experiments with cryptocurrencies, such as JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, which is meant to speed up corporate payments. The largest U.S. lenders have also promoted a new real-time payments service spearheaded by The Clearing House.Regulatory ResponseThere have been cases where startups were assessed for compliance lapses. And Libra’s debut drew attention from regulators, as members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee promised hearings on the digital coin and its governance.John Smith, who used to lead the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said tech companies and the banks they work with “will be held accountable” if they violate the law.“There’s a view within the fintechs that, ‘We couldn’t possibly do the rules that big banks do because we’re trying to be quick,’” Smith, co-head of Morrison & Foerster’s national security law practice, said Friday at a conference. “There’s going to be a rude awakening.”&#92;--With assistance from Lananh Nguyen, Michelle F.

Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has done the unthinkable, beating tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the streaming set-top box race, and keeping Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in check.Source: Shutterstock In that light, the incredible bullishness that's driven Roku stock price higher by more than 600% since its 2017 IPO isn't all that shocking.  * 3 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy Today If you missed the boat thus far though, now's not the time to jump into Roku stock. While it feels like the 300% advance of Roku stock price just since the end of last year is never going to stop, the fact of the matter is, big swings are the norm for this name. And too many signs already suggest the Roku stock price has peaked, even if just temporarily.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ROKU Is Poised for a PullbackMost of the time, stocks more or less reflect their underlying value. Certainly, adjustments for the uncertainty of the future have to be made, and the market's broad tide can work for or against a particular equity. By and large, though, stock prices usually make some sense.Roku stock is repeatedly proving an exception to that norm.That's not to suggest the incredible rally of Roku stock so far this year has been entirely unmerited. As previously noted, the company did the unlikely by dethroning the likes of Google and Apple in the streaming set-top box arena, and it continues to grow. Indeed, ROKU has only recently found the winning formula for selling ad space in conjunction with selling hardware.ROKU is a stock, however, that is still figuring out its limits.  The weekly chart of Roku stock tells the tale. This year's big advance has carried Roku stock price up to a ceiling connecting the peaks from early 2018 and the latter portion of 2018 [the surge in late 2017 was post-IPO volatility, and shouldn't be factored in]. Along the way, a relatively new ceiling that connects recent higher highs with the streak of higher highs in March has taken shape. Notice that the buyers of Roku stock were unwilling to keep pushing beyond either boundary.That's not the only red flag at this point, however. Neither is the fact that the 300% gain of Roku stock price in less than six months has pushed the limit of what should be possible.Rather, the most concerning aspect of this chart is how buying volume has been sinking since mid-May, even though Roku stock price has continued to edge higher.Without more buyers, the rally can't last. In fact, a closer look at the chart reveals that the momentum of Roku stock has already petered out. Last week's and the prior week's closes were notably below the intraweek highs. ROKU is struggling to hold into its big gain. The Outlook of ROKUIt's not the end of the world. Roku stock will most assuredly bounce back. Comebacks have been the norm for ROKU. The trick is simply figuring out where the bottom might take shape or spotting it as it's happening. Easier said than done, particularly right now , since there's no chart history that tells us much about ROKU's future lows.One possible framework that might come into play is  Fibonacci retracement lines. This obscure trading tool says the most likely landing points are around $77 and then $57.50.Wherever that low ends up being made though, odds are uncomfortably high that it will be too far below the stock's current value to simply &quot;ride out&quot; the decline.  Again, this is a name that's still looking for its post-IPO groove. With all the telltale clues of a decline in place, the risk of staying in ROKU looks much greater than the risk of getting out of it.As of this writing, James Brumley held no position in any of the aforementioned securities.

If the trade-war rhetoric starts to improve though, AAPL could be a big winner.Over $200 puts $210+ on the table. If $200 is resistance though, look for trend and moving average support between $192.50 and $194. Otherwise, AAPL may need more time to setup. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Exxon Mobil  Click to EnlargeAbove is a long-term weekly chart of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). While not displayed, the stock barely reclaimed and closed above both its 50-day and 200-day moving average on Thursday. On Friday, it added to those gains, as it's now over the 50-week moving average as well (that's actually shown above).So now what?I want to see if XOM can put together a rally up toward $80, currently downtrend resistance (blue line). Above that mark calls for a test of range resistance near $83. Should shares falter from current levels, a decline to its 200-week moving average near $75 is in play. Below that and uptrend support around $73 is on the table, with range support at $70 just below that.Keep it simple and visual. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Invitae  Click to EnlargeInvitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) really burst onto the scene this year, running from about $10 in January to $26.77 in April. Wow, what a run! But the whole long setup fell apart when a head-and-shoulder formation sent shares reeling once neckline support near $22.50 gave way.Since then, $17 support held up fine as shares have been making their way higher once again. Friday's action looked disappointing, but long-term bulls have to be happy with it holding its 20-day and 50-day moving averages.NVTA is a speculative holding, but looks set for big long-term gains in my view.I would love to see it push through this $22 to $22.50 area, which marks prior neckline support as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). If it does, look for a gap fill up toward $24. If it can't push through $22.50, see if its moving averages can buoy the name again. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: The Trade Desk  Click to EnlargeAnother high-octane growth name has been The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD).Earlier this month, we called TTD a better sell than buy up near $260 channel resistance. While it wasn't overbought, going from $200 to $260 in just five trading sessions was too far, too fast.Momentum is starting to roll over (blue circle) and TTD is coming under pressure. I don't know if the 20-day saves it or if it will fall to the 50-day. Will it return to $200? I really don't know -- no one does.However, bulls who wisely took profits can start to rebuild a position near any of these key levels. It just depends on how comfortable they feel with the potential risk. $231 marked the recent low this month, so perhaps the 20-day isn't a bad spot to nibble. I would love another shot at TTD closer to $200 though. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Nio  Click to EnlargeThis is another one we recently warned investors about. Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) stock rallied up to prior downtrend support and the 20-day moving average.On Friday, these marks ruthlessly swatted Nio lower, as shares collapsed more than 8%. Now the $2.50 level is back on the table. Below and Nio stock will look quite ugly. Simply put, this is not one I want to be long.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 If $2.50 holds, we need to see a move over the 20-day and downtrend resistance before it's even close to being a buy.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

1912,0.9954,"At first glance, everything appears to be going right for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). After a tough second half of last year, and some unnecessary personal scandals involving CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon stock regained its mojo. Having spent the last two weeks climbing back to above the $1,900 barrier, AMZN stock seems, psychologically, ready for the trip to $2,000.Source: Shutterstock But is that really the case? Another possibility is that the $2,000 level will represent strong technical resistance for Amazon stock. Let's face it: this recent bout of bullishness couldn't have come at a more awkward time.Primarily, the U.S.-China trade war imposes an overhang on AMZN stock. Because the ecommerce juggernaut is levered toward multiple businesses, thanks to its disruption ethos, Amazon had some geopolitical protection. However, even a dominant force like this can't ignore the prospects for prolonged tensions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half And by the way, the multiple disruptions are also risk factors. For example, a drawn-out trade war will likely result in a million Americans losing their jobs. That would create a ripple effect that would devastate consumer sentiment.Obviously, such a situation will hurt most aspects of AMZN stock, not just e-commerce.Still, I think AMZN is a remarkable organization. Hard evidence also shows that standard business rules don't apply to the company. Therefore, despite some nearer-term challenges, I like Amazon stock for the long haul. Here are three reasons why: Alexa? Are Smart Speakers a Game-changer for AMZN Stock?If you just looked at the technical charts for Amazon stock, you'd come to a mistaken assumption that the underlying company has no ongoing controversies. Of course, the reality is that Jeff Bezos and company are surely feeling some regulatory heat.I say this because the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are eyeballing the FAANG stocks for improprieties. In addition to AMZN, we're talking about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Fortunately for streaming investors, Netflix is off this undesirable list.These particular investigations focus on anti-competitive practices. But the broader point is that, as a large organization, Amazon attracts regulatory attention. This attention covers a range of issues. For instance, Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal sparked privacy concerns against other tech firms, including AMZN.Given the rising trend of anti-big business sentiments, Amazon stock faces longer-term challenges. But its recent development involving its Echo smart speakers could redirect oversight issues in a favorable direction.Bloomberg ran a story explaining that the Echo could detect the unusual sleeping noises associated with heart attacks. It's quite literally a life-saving technology that deserves additional investigation and support.It also flips the privacy issue on its back. In this case, you'd want the Echo to violate your privacy if it means saving a loved one's life.Not only that, Amazon can make the argument that its large organizational structure is needed to develop these groundbreaking innovations. That might put oversight committees in a difficult position, indirectly helping AMZN stock. Amazon Stock to Rise from Comprehensive Retail DominanceI don't blame investors for experiencing some confusion when dealing with Amazon stock. The underlying firm spreads its disruptive canvas far and wide. From cloud computing to groceries, Amazon does it all.But from an investment perspective, it's important not to forget the core catalyst driving AMZN stock: retail. Sure, divisions like AWS and the aforementioned smart-speaker lineup offer compelling narratives. However, this is still very much a retail play.To that end, Amazon is getting very exciting again. First, let's mention the obvious: e-commerce is steadily representing a greater piece of the total-retail sales pie. In the first quarter of this year, more than 10% of all retail revenue originated from e-commerce platforms.All indications suggest that this trend will move higher. Even during recessions, e-commerce has made strides. Since Amazon dominates the digital marketplace, it's only logical to assume AMZN stock also jumps in value.Moreover, Amazon is also going after the last holdout of the modern retail environment: lower-income consumers. People in this category prefer shopping at big-box discount chains or dollar stores. But AMZN will introduce a series of incentives, including EBT-card acceptance, to sway this demographic.Let's give it up for management, which is making yet-another smart decision. With the 5G rollout coming, telecommunication services will reach a wider audience. Older but still very adequate technologies will become cheaper, encouraging lower-income consumers to advantage e-commerce conveniences.And when you're talking e-commerce, all roads eventually lead to Amazon stock. Old Rules Don't Apply to AMZNI hesitate to mention this, but when you look at Amazon as a whole, you can't help but think that it's a near-miraculous company.Usually, organizations involved in disparate businesses attract criticism. That's especially true today, with the likes of General Electric (NYSE:GE) struggling for both traction and relevancy.AMZN really shouldn't be doing so well. It wasn't satisfied dominating e-commerce, so it moved into multiple sectors: physical commerce, cloud computing, video games, groceries, health care, and the list goes on. It's a modern-day GE.Yet they find a way to make it work. Since at least Q4 2006, Amazon has never experienced year-over-year revenue growth below double digits. That's just a remarkable phenomenon made even more impressive that the company must contend with the law of large numbers.Overall, this gives me the confidence that you can hurt Amazon stock, but you'll never keep it down forever.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1914,0.6499,"(Bloomberg) -- The billionaire founder of Apple Inc.’s largest supplier asked the U.S. company to move from China to neighboring Taiwan.&quot;Speaking from the perspective of the Republic of China, I will plead to Apple to come to Taiwan,&quot; said Terry Gou, who remains the largest shareholder in Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., answering a question about whether Apple will shift production away from China. He was referring to Taiwan by its formal moniker. “I believe it is possible,&quot; he said without elaborating.Louis Woo, a special assistant to Gou, later said that the executive and Taiwan presidential hopeful was urging Apple to &quot;invest&quot; in Taiwan, not to move plants from China.The Trump administration’s threat to levy tariffs on some $300 billion of Chinese-made goods -- including phones and laptops -- has inflamed speculation that Apple will divert some capacity away from the world’s second largest economy. And Hon Hai is the largest of hundreds of Apple-suppliers with factories on the mainland, making most of the world’s iPhones from the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou.A significant shift of manufacturing from China to Taiwan -- which Beijing views as part of its territory -- may also exacerbate tensions between the two governments. Hon Hai, the main listed arm of the Foxconn Technology Group, is today the largest private employer in China, paying as many as a million mostly migrant laborers to put together everything from iPhones to HP laptops.Gou, who is stepping down as Hon Hai chairman Friday to focus on winning a party nomination to compete in the 2020 Taiwanese presidential elections, had run a company that depends on Apple for half its revenue. It’s unclear how much capacity Gou may have been referring to, nor how feasible a large-scale move -- for Hon Hai or any other Apple supplier -- may be.The Taiwanese firms that assemble most of the world’s electronics are now expanding or exploring plants in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to escape punitive tariffs on U.S.-bound goods. But the vast majority of their capabilities remain rooted in China. The Nikkei reported this week that Apple asked its largest suppliers to consider the costs of shifting 15% to 30% of its output from China to Southeast Asia, but three major partners to the U.S. company later pushed back against that idea. Hon Hai itself has said Apple hasn’t requested such a move.(Updates with comment from Gou special assistant in third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.035,0.922,0.042,1

1923,0.9952,"The reaction to earnings at Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offered more proof that cloud applications are kings of this stock market.Source: Shutterstock Adobe, which moved its picture and video editors to the cloud early this decade, earned $632 million, $1.30 per share, on revenue of $2.744 billion during the three months ending in May. The earnings were 5 cents short of a year ago, well short of analyst estimates, but revenue was 25% ahead. Guidance was considered soft.But Adobe stock took off anyway, rising almost $17.50 per share over the next 24 hours, opening for trade June 20 at $294 per share. This added about $7 billion to the market cap, which stood at $142 billion. Adobe is up almost 29% in 2019 and over 300% over the last five years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPretty good for what is, by Silicon Valley standards, a mature company. The Marketing CloudAdobe was founded in 1982 around PostScript, a page description language, and during the rest of the 20th century it grew by acquiring other, related products for pictures and video. By the middle of the 2000s, however, it was languishing.Then CEO Shantanu Narayen committed the company to the cloud.Not only did Adobe find new profits by hosting its software online, but Adobe found new markets. In addition to its Creative Cloud, where you'll find most of its older software, its star product is now its marketing software, called Adobe Experience Cloud, designed to help create, and measure, online and offline marketing efforts.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills The result has been what TV analyst Jim Cramer calls the &quot;golden age of creativity,&quot; with websites crushing brick-and-mortar retailers. This doesn't just help big retailers, but smaller ones like Rite Aid (NASDAQ:RAD), which is using Adobe to pull data from multiple sources and help pharmacists get treatments right with improved patient compliance.Along the way, Adobe has increasingly collided with Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) as both seek to become customers' Data Management Platform of choice for sales and marketing. So far there seems to be plenty of room for both. The losers are stores that don't use these new tools and vendors of older tools like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which are now being bypassed. Facing FutureHaving creative and marketing applications in the cloud not only improves Adobe's own time to market, it lets all its customers stay on top of the latest trends in Web marketing and the fight against fraud.When Adobe learns how to detect faces that have been edited online, all its customers can too. When its new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad software for artists, now called Fresco, is ready for launch, all its customers will get it at once.Narayen's key decision wasn't just to commit to cloud, but to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its Azure cloud. The two companies are increasingly connected, with seamless integration between Adobe's cloud and Microsoft Office applications.This will inevitably lead some to talk of a merger, but don't expect one. Microsoft has learned, from its antitrust experience 20 years ago, not to consume the markets it creates. Close partnerships give it the dominance it craves without the risk of government interference. The Bottom Line on Adobe StockThe rapid rise in Adobe stock has some technicians putting up stop signs on it, but options traders who bet on a move higher were big winners.As cloud applications become the norm, ADBE has a clear field ahead of it. The only thing keeping it off some analyst buy lists is its valuation, well over 10 times sales and 54 times earnings.But in a hot market you don't get a diamond by buying zirconium, and ADBE stock skeptics are falling in line.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

1937,0.9929,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Central banks and financial regulators have been on high alert since the launch of Facebook Inc.’s proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. It’s still at the conceptual stage, but the prospect of a tech giant with 2.6 billion users shuffling digital money around and backing it with piles of dollars, euros and pounds is a potential heart attack in the making for those trying to keep the financial system stable, governable and predictable. That means setting the rules now, before Libra’s born.One idea as to how officials might keep CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s dreams grounded in reality is to get under the hood of what goes into the digital currency in the first place. Given Libra wants to back every digital cent with a mix of real-world reserve currencies, that might be the best place to start. Bank of England boss Mark Carney hinted at this in his Mansion House speech on Thursday, proposing that tech firms and other non-banks be allowed to hold funds directly at the central bank.You can see why this idea would appeal. If central banks start to hold deposits for the likes of Facebook and other Libra backers, officials will get a first-hand view of the assets held in reserve (though they’ll have to coordinate for a complete picture). And for the tech companies, having the central bank’s blessing is the ultimate seal of approval and trust — something Zuckerberg could benefit from. It would all require a fair bit of readjustment in terms of what a central bank does and how it does it, but it makes sense.While this will all seem like a specific issue of financial plumbing off the back of a crypto project, there’s a much bigger point here about finance and tech in general — and not all of it comforting for bankers.Carney’s push for new tech companies to be embedded more deeply in the financial system will raise competitive pressure on incumbent banks. The regulatory barriers to entry in finance are already high — think of the billions spent on compliance — and it’s a reason why Silicon Valley hasn’t yet posed an extinction threat for banks. But officials want more firms to clear those barriers, “leveling the playing field between old and new,” Carney says. Hence, he also talked up the central bank’s payments system overhaul, with a view to plugging in tech firms. Libra could just be a face that launches a thousand ships of new payments ideas – the crypto bit might never take off, but other ideas will.Banks have done a decent job of fending off fintech over the past decade: 35 percent of British consumers have had the same account for at least two decades, according to UBS. But that’s partly because their opponents have been pretty under-powered: No amount of glitzy tech conferences featuring entrepreneurs kitted out in lederhosen can disguise that. Start-ups have been forced down a risky path to grow fast in a market that’s highly regulated and concentrated.Facebook, as well as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are different. They have size: Apple is in “a billion pockets,” as Oprah Winfrey put it. They have money: Alphabet’s revenue in a single quarter could cover the market cap of Deutsche Bank several times over. And they have data: Amazon has our credit card details, and indeed its own card. With their main businesses drawing tough criticism over monopoly concerns, more diversification — even into a very regulated sector — is investor-friendly.Libra specifically may well be a pipe dream that may never be implemented in its current form. But Facebook’s size means that central banks already have to take it seriously — or they face being unprepared to ensure financial stability. Bankers themselves aren’t powerless to respond to the tech threat, and they have the financial firepower to develop services and products.

1944,0.9301,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones, has named Young Liu its new chairman to replace billionaire founder Terry Gou.Hon Hai said the semiconductor division chief’s appointment takes effect July 1, taking up a post vacated by Gou. The Taiwanese billionaire, who built the company from a maker of TV knobs into a global consumer electronics powerhouse, is stepping down to focus on winning a party nomination to compete in the 2020 Taiwanese presidential elections. Hon Hai’s shares slid more than 1%.Liu takes the helm at a precarious time for the world’s largest contract manufacturer, known also as Foxconn. Escalating U.S.-Chinese tensions are hurting consumer sentiment and raising fears about the impact on Foxconn’s plants, most of which are located in the world’s No. 2 economy. Washington is threatening to hit Beijing with new tariffs on about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods including phones and laptops -- directly affecting Hon Hai’s business with Apple and the world’s biggest electronics brands. And Beijing has shown a growing willingness to retaliate against American names.Gou had long been expected to step back from Foxconn’s day-to-day operations to focus on his political endeavors. He remains a board member and largest shareholder, but formally handed the baton over on Friday during the company’s annual general meeting in Taipei.“I have very complicated feelings,” Liu told reporters after the meeting wrapped. “I will work to maximize the shareholders’ interest.”Read a live blog of Hon Hai’s Friday AGM here(Updates with effective date from the second paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.031,0.889,0.08,1

1965,0.0142,"(Bloomberg) -- A top Democrat in the U.S. House said Thursday that big tech has had “devastating effects” on everyday Americans.Speaking at an antitrust conference in Washington, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who has opened an investigation into competition in the technology industry, said Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have acquired competitors to corner their markets.Cicilline, who is also chairman of an antitrust subcommittee, said “you would be amazed” at the number of companies that have come forward with concerns about the potentially unfair way that big tech companies compete. Some have even expressed fear that the tech giants will respond with economic retaliation if the smaller companies’ concerns are made public, Cicilline said, without providing more detail. He said Congress has retreated from its active role in shaping antitrust law.Email messages seeking comment were left with Facebook and Google.Cicilline has become a leading figure responding to the rising calls from Democrats and some Republicans for tougher competition enforcement. The Judiciary Committee is investigating competition in technology markets while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have divided oversight of the biggest companies, the first step toward formal probes. Google and Apple Inc. went to the Justice Department, while the FTC will be responsible for Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.During a June 11 hearing that kicked off the House probe, lawmakers including Cicilline slammed online platforms for being unfair gatekeepers to content produced by traditional media outlets.“Concentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction,” he said at the time.Seeking SolutionsThe major challenge of his investigation, Cicilline said Thursday, will be to find a solution to competition issues in the tech industry -- whether it’s changing antitrust laws or making sure enforcement agencies have enough resources to carry out their mission. The problems are easier to identify and harder “to develop solutions around,” he said.Cicilline said he has reached out to representatives of most of the major tech platforms and indicated that his hope is they will participate in a “meaningful way.” When asked whether he was prioritizing a company in the investigation, Cicilline said he wasn’t but mentioned Google and Facebook as particularly big and well-known.“We’ve seen some conduct of Facebook in particular, some pretty egregious behavior and a pattern of bad behavior, apology tour from the CEO and then back to bad behavior,” the representative said.His panel, Cicilline said, will explore why there hasn’t been a “serious antitrust investigation” in 20 years. “One thing I’m certain of is we are in this monopoly moment where I think people have begun to really understand the implications of this concentration in the marketplace. They expect us to address it in a thoughtful and responsible way.”Asked whether the agencies had failed, Cicilline said, “Yes. Congress has failed too, in fairness. This has been a failure by everyone.”Cicilline also weighed in on allegations of anti-conservative bias by large tech companies, which some Republicans including President Donald Trump have suggested could be a competition problem. Cicilline said there was “no evidence” to back that up.(Updates with Cicilline comments in third paragraph and details throughout.)To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.06,0.862,0.078,0

1976,-0.3057,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. urged the Trump administration not to proceed with tariffs of as much as 25% on a new slate of products imported from China, saying it would reduce the company’s contribution to the U.S. economy.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant made the plea in a letter to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer this week. Tariffs will affect nearly all major Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, AirPods, and the iMac, the company wrote. It would also hurt lower volume products like the HomePod speaker, some Beats headphones, wireless routers, the Apple TV box, cases, and iPhone replacement parts.“We urge you not to proceed with these tariffs,” Apple said.This is the first time Apple has specifically mentioned the iPhone on a list of products that would be impacted by tariffs. The smartphone generates about two-thirds of Apple sales and drives the purchase of other devices and services.Apple is one of the largest job creators in the U.S., it said, responsible for more than 2 million positions. The company also said it is the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer. Apple has pledged to make a direct contribution to the U.S. economy of more than $350 billion over five years, and said it’s on track to meet that goal.The U.S. and China said their presidents will meet in Japan next week to relaunch trade talks after a month-long stalemate.Apple spent decades building one of the largest supply chains in the world. The company designs and sells most of its products in the U.S., but imports them from China after assembly. That makes it one of the most exposed companies to tariffs. The company may be evaluating moving some production out of China to elsewhere in Asia, according to a recent Nikkei report.Apple’s global supply chain has helped it efficiently pump out hundreds of millions of devices, making the company one of the most-profitable in the world. But the approach relies on cheap labor and the relatively free movement of goods between nations. The trade war between the U.S. and China is a threat to this lucrative status quo.&quot;What has benefited Apple in the past may turn full circle and harm their super-normal margins in the future,&quot; Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Securities Ltd., wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. &quot;While Apple attempts to portray itself as pivoting to a services company the bare fact remains that more than 60% of profit is generated by the iPhone.&quot;In the past, when it has been up against local taxes on the sale of products built elsewhere, Apple has re-located production within that country. Apple is now building iPhones in India to avoid a local tax in the region, while it conducted similar measures several years ago in Brazil for selling iPhones.However, moving production out of China is not without risk. The company’s suppliers employ millions of people in China and its relationship with the government there is partly based on this contribution to the economy. Moving out of China could threaten some of these jobs, hurting the relationship with the government and raising potential roadblocks to sales of iPhones and services like Apple Music and iCloud in the country.Last year, Apple told Lighthizer that tariffs could affect AirPods, some Macs and the Apple Watch. The company was granted a reprieve when the government said it would leave the Apple Watch from being impacted.In its letter this week to the U.S. government, Apple said that the tariffs would weigh on its global competitiveness. It also stressed its impact on the U.S. economy. &quot;The Chinese producers we compete with in global markets do not have a significant presence in the U.S. market, and so would not be impacted by U.S. tariffs,&quot; Apple said.Apple’s letter was filed during the public comment period for proposed tariffs on about $300 billion in Chinese goods as the U.S. tries to finalize a deal with China that addresses the trade deficit, allegations of intellectual property theft and other trade practices.Hundreds of U.S. companies and trade groups are appearing at a seven-day public hearing through June 25, mostly to oppose the duties as a tax on businesses and consumers. The duties could be imposed after a rebuttal period ends July 2.&#92;--With assistance from Molly Schuetz.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Mark Niquette in Columbus at mniquette@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.053,0.899,0.048,-1

2013,0.9997,"Following the 2019 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the video game industry's biggest conference of the year, two things have become abundantly clear. Cloud gaming is the future of the gaming industry and that future is coming soon.Cloud gaming is broadly defined as the ability to stream video games through the cloud, without any chunky hardware or lengthy downloads, and play those video games on any internet-connected device, like a smart TV, computer or smartphone. It's basically Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but for video games. Consumers pay a monthly fee to play video games through the cloud. And, much like Netflix uprooted traditional television due to its pricing and convenience advantages, cloud streaming services will uproot the traditional video game industry due to the same price and convenience advantages.As such, cloud gaming is inevitably the future of the gaming industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat future is coming soon … very soon. At E3, many of the leading players in this industry announced that their cloud gaming services would have limited roll-outs later this year, and full launches in 2020. Thus, it seems inevitable that the video game industry in the early 2020's will be one dominated by a shift from traditional video game consumption, to cloud gaming consumption.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever The investment implication of that shift? Stocks on the right side of the cloud gaming shift should win big in the early 2020's. With that in mind, let's take a look at six cloud gaming stocks to buy to play this secular pivot. Alphabet (GOOG)Source: Shutterstock For all intents and purposes, it looks like internet search and cloud giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has taken the lead in developing a true cloud gaming service.Alphabet first announced its cloud gaming service, dubbed Stadia, in March. At it's pre-E3 event, Alphabet divulged more details about Stadia. Broadly, there are two parts here. First, the hardware, which is just a controller to play the games. Second, the software, which is Stadia Pro and enables gamers to stream a library of video games to multiple devices. The controller costs about $70. Pro costs about $10 per month, so similar to Netflix pricing. The service presently supports about 30 games, but will grow over time. All of this is set for a limited roll-out in November 2019, and a full launch in 2020.All in all, Alphabet is set to launch its true cloud gaming service Stadia later this year. That early launch will give Stadia a first mover's advantage in this market. Further, Alphabet has a big enough data center network around the world that Stadia should be able to turn that first mover's advantage, into a long-term advantage, meaning Stadia does project as an important player in the cloud gaming world at scale.Is that a reason to buy GOOG stock? Yes. Cloud gaming will help lessen Alphabet's reliance on advertising revenues, and broaden and lengthen Alphabet's growth narrative. That will ultimately push GOOG stock higher. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Right behind Alphabet in the cloud gaming world is peer global tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Microsoft just announced its Project xCloud, which is the company's cloud gaming initiative that launches in October 2019 and allows gamers to stream Xbox games across a variety of different devices. Project xCloud is different from Stadia in many ways. First, we don't have many details on xCloud. Second, xCloud is more of a cloud extension of Microsoft's Xbox console than anything else. Third, the goal of xCloud isn't to create a consolidated cloud gaming platform; rather, it's to get gamers to play Xbox games more frequently across multiple different devices.As such, xCloud in its current status will serve as a perfect cloud complement to the Xbox. Naturally, that positions xCloud to get a big early user base through current Xbox owners. Further, Microsoft has a large enough global hyper-scale data-center presence to support xCloud being arguably the best performing cloud gaming service in the world.  * 7 Fantastic Fidelity Funds for a Range of Investors Will MSFT stock move higher because of xCloud? Perhaps. MSFT stock goes as its cloud businesses go and xCloud is a cloud business. Traction in xCloud could consequently excite the investor base, and push Microsoft stock higher. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock There are four big tech companies with $700 billion-plus market caps. Three of them are jumping into the cloud gaming space. We've already talked about two of them: Alphabet and Microsoft. Now, let's talk about the third -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Apple is jumping into cloud gaming with its Apple Arcade service. In short, Apple is taking all the best games in the App Store, putting them in a gaming library in the cloud, and allowing consumers to access that library for a monthly fee. That monthly fee hasn't been announced yet, but will probably wind up somewhere around $10 per month. Also, gamers can access Apple Arcade on mobile or through a computer.This is a big move for Apple. The company's bread-and-butter, the iPhone business, is running out of growth runway. Apple is rapidly pivoting into the software and services space to help offset slowing hardware growth. This pivot is working … to a degree. But, it will work a whole lot better if Apple can successfully turn Arcade into a mobile/PC gaming equivalent of Netflix.Is that possible? Sure. Apple has huge market share in smartphones and computers, and they will leverage that huge physical presence to help push their software services, which should increase adoption and help these relatively new services scale quite quickly. As Arcade does scale quickly, the Services business will get a boost, and AAPL stock will move higher. Electronic Arts (EA)Source: Shutterstock The dark horse in the cloud gaming wars is video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), which announced its cloud gaming platform Project Atlas back in 2018.Details on Project Atlas are scant, and from a media coverage and announcements perspective, it seems to have fallen behind Stadia, xCloud and Apple Arcade. Nonetheless, EA has a leg up here because it is a video game publisher that owns the content that many gamers want to play. As we've seen with Netflix and the video streaming wars, content is everything. Thus, EA comes into the cloud gaming world with a winning hand.Will that winning hand help EA create a market-leading cloud gaming platform? Perhaps. We still don't know what this market will look like in the future. But, we do know that whatever the market does end up looking like, EA will be a part of the picture, either as a cross-platform content provider, or a cloud gaming platform owner.  * 7 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for Sunny Long-Term Returns Either way, the cloud gaming pivot is a good thing for EA. It will push revenues higher, increase revenue visibility and help expand the multiple on EA stock. All three of those things will help move EA stock higher in the long run. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: AMD The first four companies on this list were potential providers of cloud streaming service. This fifth company, however, is the chip giant that is powering those cloud streaming services behind the scenes.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a CPU and GPU company that services many different end markets. One of those end market is gaming. AMD does pretty well in gaming with its GPU chips. For example, the company's GPU chips have long been the fuel behind Microsoft's Xbox gaming consoles. Now, as tech giants are pivoting their gaming services to the cloud, many of them are tapping AMD to power their cloud gaming platforms, too.Namely, Microsoft's xCloud streaming service and Alphabet's Stadia streaming service will both be built on AMD GPUs. Those are the two premiere, leading cloud gaming services, and both of them are tapping AMD for their GPU power.That's impressive. If AMD can maintain this trend of being the go-to GPU power behind the cloud gaming industry, then AMD's revenues and profits will see a nice lift. That nice lift could provide an equally nice lift to AMD stock in the long run. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Shutterstock Last, but not least, in this list of relevant cloud gaming stocks to buy is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the chip giant that has dual exposure to the cloud gaming market.On one end, Nvidia has already built its own cloud gaming service, called GeForce Now. According to most accounts and sources, GeForce Now is probably the best cloud gaming service out there right now. But, it's limited. It focuses exclusively on computer games, and is in a beta, invite-only phase. Nvidia has not mentioned any intentions to open the floodgates for GeForce Now. As such, while Nvidia has built one of the world's best cloud computer gaming platforms, that platform isn't set for a commercial roll-out just yet.Perhaps that's because on the other end, Nvidia makes the GPU chips that are the building blocks for cloud gaming services. Nvidia has long been considered the king of the GPU market, and king of the data-center market. Naturally, that positioning makes them seem like the obvious choice to power cloud gaming platforms.Net net, Nvidia has established dominance in the markets which are the fundamental building blocks for cloud gaming. In the long run, Nvidia will either leverage that dominance to build the best game streaming platform, or be the best provider of game streaming building blocks.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Is this a big deal for NVDA stock? Absolutely. Nvidia's long-term growth narrative is all about cloud, AI and data, and cloud gaming is a big part of that narrative. As such, cloud gaming should be one of the many reasons why NVDA stock heads higher in the long run.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX, GOOG, AAPL, EA and NVDA.

2017,0.9948,"Over the past few months FAANG stocks have been lagging broader markets. Despite grabbing a good chunk of headlines, they have not been exhibiting strength from a performance standpoint.Source: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in particular has really struggled despite running an incredibly diverse company with a huge amount of embedded option value. Google stock has clearly been the laggard of the FAANG lot, and it still has not quite recovered from an unexpected first-quarter earnings miss that sent shares plummeting at the beginning of May.Over the past week, however, FAANG stocks have come roaring back. Over a time horizon of the past three months, GOOGL stock is down 7.6%, while the Nasdaq is up just over 3%, but as we look over the past month, GOOGL stock has managed to narrow that underperformance somewhat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe arrows are pointing to a continued outperformance, especially with positive news in the trade war area lifting markets as a whole. As money continues to be deployed and investors reexamine just how strong Google's value proposition is, there is ample room for GOOGL stock to continue its outperformance. Google Stock LeadershipFirst a note on Alphabet stock's leadership, as it seems to come up more and more in conversations I have about the company. More than once I have heard shareholders voice the opinion that founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page  do not care about shareholders, and that they seemed to not offer much hopeful commentary on the disappointing first quarter.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half And it is true that on the surface, it appears that Tim Cook of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example, is more shareholder-friendly than Brin and Page. He commits to share buybacks and Apple sports a 1.6% dividend. He also goes on financial talk shows to espouse the virtues of the company. Brin and Page have done none of the above.However, this is a rather myopic view.Google's approach is arguably more beneficial to shareholders in the long-term. Instead of burning up cash by giving it back to shareholders to prop up the stock (not that it seems to need it) like Apple has been doing for years now, Google is investing in a number of technologies and projects that have huge potential.These are not incremental tweaks but truly transformational technologies. GOOGL Is Betting on the FutureThere simply is not another company that can rival Google in the number of products and services with the same amount of monetization potential.An outdated Wall Street Journal article from 2015 is a common source for bears that argue YouTube is unprofitable. While there is no disclosed information on whether or not that has changed, any routine user of YouTube would be surprised to know that it isn't very profitable in 2019.Margins and other financial metrics are mostly guesswork, but with the major increase in advertisements and YouTube TV gaining traction, how can it not be? The network effects are mind-blowing and may just be the most valuable asset within Google aside from the core search business.Waymo and Google Maps aren't producing profit yet, but they are growing rapidly and undeniably loaded with potential to become a major force in non-cyclical industries. Right now the market is not giving GOOGL stock any real credit for these transformative technologies, but think about how the stock will react if just one of their many assets starts to &quot;work.&quot; The Bottom Line on GOOGL StockBuying into this newfound momentum as investors seem to be stepping back into the big-tech FAANG names should turn out to be a profitable move. As a group, they will all probably do well, but Google is the best bang for buck.Right now GOOGL stock trades at just 28x trailing price-to-earnings ratio. It has been cheaper than this in the past, but the current value is undeniable. This is the time and place to double down on a temporary market dislocation.As of this writing, Luce Emerson was long GOOG stock.

2018,-0.9945,"(Bloomberg) -- Of the five biggest tech companies in the U.S., Microsoft is the only one that isn't currently in the crosshairs of U.S. antitrust authorities. The software giant already took its turn through the regulatory wringer starting two decades ago, a years-long confrontation that resulted in the finding that the Redmond, Washington-based company had illegally maintained its monopoly for personal-computer operating-system software. The case dealt with the company's moves to kneecap the Netscape web browser by bundling its own product, Internet Explorer, into Windows, the dominant PC operating system.A federal judge ordered the company split in two in 2000, a fate Microsoft avoided when an appeals court reversed that part of the ruling and the company eventually settled. That 2002 settlement led to nine years of court supervision of the company's business practices and required Microsoft to give the top 20 computer makers identical contract terms for licensing Windows, and gave computer makers greater freedom to promote non-Microsoft products like browsers and media-playing software. Because observers and legal pundits almost uniformly agree the software giant did virtually everything wrong in the course of the investigation -- which had its start as early as 1990, followed by a 1998 Justice Department lawsuit -- in retrospect its story serves as a useful instruction manual of what not to do.While no formal inquiries have yet been opened, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department carved up the territory of big tech -- Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. -- as they prepare to dig in on antitrust issues. The Department of Justice will look at Google, which dominates the online search and advertising spaces, and Apple, whose pervasive App Store is likely to be under examination. The FTC drew Facebook, with its behemoth social networking and messaging apps and a slew of recent privacy missteps, and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has been pushing into areas like grocery and health. As these companies build their legal teams and prepare strategies for the fight ahead, here are several lessons that Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook can learn from Microsoft's battle with the feds.Don't deny the obvious. Or don't even put up a fight about whether you have a monopoly. Microsoft, whose Windows software accounted for about 90% of the market for PC operating systems, opted to argue that the space was actually competitive. Parts of the argument included videos where Microsoft employees offered a straight-faced marketing pitch for the benefits of rival Linux programs with a tiny share of the market. The impulse is understandable -- monopoly sounds like a dirty word. But U.S. antitrust law doesn't expressly forbid having a monopoly; it outlaws doing certain things to establish, maintain or extend one. That led some legal scholars to argue that Microsoft would have been better served by copping to the Windows monopoly and establishing a legal beachhead against the idea that it did anything illegal to gain it or keep it. Arguing against something so self-evident via the company's very first witness strained credibility and started the case off on a bad footing.It's easy to imagine a similar issue applying to Google, which has more than 84% of the web-search market and controls 82% of mobile-phone operating systems. In the app-store business, Google and iPhone maker Apple together control more than 95% of all U.S. mobile app spending by consumers, according to Sensor Tower data. Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier this month told CBS that his company doesn’t have a dominant position in any market. But regulators may look at the power it wields through its app store. It could be more effective for these companies not to start by denying that leadership position -- if you have 80% or 90% percent of a market, arguing that you don't really dominate isn't the hill you want your legal reasoning to die on. Don’t resort to spin. Microsoft's credibility with the press was no higher, hurt by constant counterfactual statements and spin. Each day, after a bruising in court as government lawyer David Boies poked holes in executive testimony and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson alternated between chuckling at the witnesses and chastising them, Microsoft deployed a hapless PR person to the steps of the courthouse to recite the words, &quot;Today was another good day for Microsoft.&quot; It never was.  Assume everything will be made public.Among the list of horrifying moments for Microsoft in court was the public showing of parts of the 20 hours of depositions of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates. The tapes (yes, they were tapes -- this was the 90s) showed an ill-lit, evasive and combative Gates engaging in Clintonian word-wrangling, such as asking about the definition of the word &quot;definition&quot; and arguing what &quot;market share&quot; meant. Microsoft claimed it had been assured the tapes would never be shown in court, or the company would have taken greater care with Gates’s appearance and manner. During their playback in court, the judge laughed at several points -- not the impression the software giant wanted to make on either Jackson or the public. Jackson told New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta that Gates came off as &quot;arrogant&quot; in the depositions.Just as bad for Microsoft, an array of internal emails were read aloud in court that contradicted the testimony of its executives, which further angered Jackson. The takeaway? Assume everything will be aired in the court of public opinion. If it was true 20 years ago, it’s even more apparent in the current era of oversharing, thanks to the tech companies’ own services. Don't be condescending about the technology. Most lawyers, judges and regulators don't appreciate being told or having it implied that they lack the ability to apprehend certain tech concepts. Or that the reason they think there's been an antitrust violation is because they just don't &quot;get&quot; the technology. It was true that Jackson and Boies seldom used a computer at the time. But it didn't require a computer science doctorate to divine the legal merits of the case.  At the height of Microsoft's hubris (or carelessness, or both), the company sent Windows chief Jim Allchin to the stand with a doctored video that purported to show how computing performance would be degraded when the browser was removed from Windows on a single PC. It was actually done on several different computers and was an illustration of what might happen rather than a factual test, as the company initially claimed -- a fact that came to light only after several days of the government picking through every inconsistency in the video. Microsoft remade the simulation several times in an effort to save the testimony. The company seemed to think it could get away with baldy stating a technological claim and mocking up something that backed it up, perhaps reasoning that no one would know the difference, but it miscalculated badly (Joe Nocera, now a Bloomberg columnist but then writing for Fortune, recounts the whole cringeworthy story).Choose your lawyers wisely.Microsoft took on the U.S. government led by a combative Gates and an equally aggressive general counsel, Bill Neukom. Gates, the son of an attorney, was outraged, frustrated and convinced the company was being unfairly targeted. One of the company’s outside lawyers, from the firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said the company could put a ham sandwich into Windows if it wanted to. And throughout, Neukom not only failed to tamp down his executives’ worst impulses, he seemed to amp them up. His legal style led observers to point out that his last name -- pronounced `nuke 'em’ -- was quite fitting.The U.S. government’s latest antitrust targets should take heed: If your top executive's style tends towards waving a red flag in front of a bull, you may be wise to consider a top lawyer with a more conciliatory style. Google’s top executives have already raised the ire of lawmakers for refusing to appear before Congress, and no one has ever accused Jeff Bezos of being afraid of a fight. At Facebook, where Zuckerberg regards Gates as a mentor and observers see similarities in their styles and temperaments, this lesson might be particularly important.There are many different ways to lose.Right now, the companies are only at risk of an inquiry -- the agencies are deciding what, if any, action to take. But even at this stage, they should keep in mind that a loss doesn’t only mean a full-scale breakup or forced divestiture. Companies can avoid that extreme fate and still find, as Microsoft did, that the years of distraction from the fight have hampered their business and sucked up executive time and mental energy.In an interview last year at the Code Conference, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith lamented the distraction the case caused, and cited it as a reason the company missed out on the search market -- the business that fueled the runaway success of Google, now under the microscope itself. Others have pinned Microsoft’s abysmal performance in mobile computing partially on constraints and distractions from the case. Some of the company’s business missteps can fairly be attributed to poor execution and strategic errors that had nothing to do with the government dispute. Still, the notion that merely fighting an antitrust battle may do almost as much harm as losing one brings us to our last point.Consider settling early.  It's hard to say with certainty what the late 1990s and early 2000s might have looked like for Microsoft had it found a way to settle with the government earlier than 2002. Still, for the government’s current targets, it's worth weighing a settlement against the impact of several years of investigation, a possible loss in court and potentially harsher restrictions or remedies. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google probably have a pretty good idea of what regulators may object to, and it’s worthwhile for them to consider ways to assuage those concerns while keeping the core of their businesses and future ambitions intact. The alternative is years of investigations, possibly damaging evidence and testimony, and ample distraction, all leading up to what could be a devastating loss in court. (Updates with earlier comments from Tim Cook. A previous version of this story corrected the attribution of an anecdote about a ham sandwich.)To contact the author of this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.093,0.829,0.078,-1

2029,0.9967,"Do you want to find the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)? My advice is that you should set your sights lower, not higher and put some cash to work in three down, but not out heavyweight biotech stocks for the next big thing in investing. Let me explain.It has been a good week so far for the broader markets. The Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have broken out of short bases barely discernible on the weekly chart and back within spitting distance of their respective all-time-highs following May's abrupt correction. It has been a nice period for biotech stocks as well.The Vaneck Vectors Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:BBH) is up nearly 3.50% through Tuesday's close compared to gains of roughly 1% to 2% for the broader averages. But as any investor with a passing interest in the markets knows, the outperformance in biotech stocks has been anything but a recurring theme these past couple years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for a Seemingly Sleepy Summer The good news is markets are cyclical. Even legendary investments such as AMZN or the sacrosanct AAPL stock have been known to correct for periods lasting not weeks, but months and even years. With that in mind, it's time to consider adding these three large-cap biotech stocks into your portfolio. Amgen (AMGN)  Click to EnlargeAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biotech heavyweight that also happens to be the sector's largest capitalization outfit with a valuation of about $110 billion.Following a recent sales and earnings beat, this reasonably-priced biotech giant, which pays investors nearly 3.5% in quarterly dividends, has now put together a bottom on the monthly price chart.Specifically, AMGN stock has formed a confirmed pivot low, which reaffirms its longstanding uptrend after a correction of several months. And with plenty of lateral, angular and Fibonacci price supports, as well as an oversold crossover signal to confirm the bottom, this biotech stock is a buy today.The TradeBuy AMGN stock at current prices. Set a stop-loss beneath support below $160, but expect shares to hit new highs in 2019's second half. Gilead Sciences (GILD)  Click to EnlargeIt has been a rough few years for Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), one the sector's largest names, but things are looking up for GILD stock lately.A recent earnings report that reiterated the company's full-year guidance and offered a modest year-over-year uptick in sales and profits looks promising for Gilead shares, which have been absolutely pummeled over the last four years.Technically, shares are trading slightly above multiple inside candlesticks following a double bottom pattern of about one and a half years. With the formation finding support off the 50% retracement level and a supportive-looking stochastics set-up signaling better months and years ahead, GILD stock looks good to buy right now.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever The TradeBuy GILD stock at current levels with an initial stop-loss below $59. On the upside, $85 - $90 looks like a good area for profit-taking while allowing this down-and-out value stock some room to run. Biogen (BIIB)  Click to EnlargeMuch like GILD stock, shares of sector heavyweight Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) have been under extreme technical duress the past few years.Most recently, the pain in BIIB stock came after the company's announcement that it was axing a drug to treat Alzheimer's following poor results. The suffering came despite the fact that BIIB posted stronger-than-forecast results in late April.On the price chart, this biotech stock's technical beating since 2015 has resulted in a possible four-year long double-bottom pattern that's finding support in-between the 50% and 62% retracement levels. Coupled with an oversold stochastics that is a hair's breadth away from signaling a bullish crossover, confirmation of the pivot low looks imminent.The TradeBuy BIIB stock above May's candle high of $238.17 to confirm the pattern bottom. I'd suggest an initial stop beneath $214 and to take partial profits in-between $300 - $310.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently do not own positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

After a downturn at the end of May, Microsoft stock has continued to climb through June, including a 1.74% gain on Tuesday that set yet another new high and gave the company a $1.04 trillion market cap. With growth of over 30% for 2019, why are investors so bullish on MSFT?Source: Shutterstock When trading closed on Tuesday, Microsoft stock was at $135.16, up 1.74% for the day. The company has been firing on all cylinders for most of June, climbing back above the $1 trillion market cap it hit for the first time on April 25. That makes MSFT more valuable than other tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $913.08 billion and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at $936.11 billion.That raises a few questions. For a tech company that's shut-out of the smartphone market altogether, a non-player in the red-hot smart speaker category and being soundly trounced by the competition in video game console sales, MSFT is doing extraordinarily well these days.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Earnings AnticipationMicrosoft is expected to release its Q4 earnings on July 18, and investors are clearly expecting to hear good news. The company's Q3 earnings were better than expected and showed especially strong growth in the company's Azure cloud computing division, which saw 73% year-over-year revenue growth. Gartner is predicting cloud computing will grow &quot;exponentially&quot; for the next several years, for total global revenue of $331 billion by 2022. MSFT is positioning itself to be a key player in this huge market and investors are anticipating those Q4 results show not just double-digit revenue and earnings growth, but continued acceleration of the company's cloud computing revenue.In the aftermath of Microsoft's Q3 earnings report, MSFT stock rose nearly 4% and the company passed a $1 trillion market valuation for the first time -- only the third U.S. company to do so, after Apple and Amazon. The performance of MSFT through June clearly shows an expectation that those Q4 earnings are going to be just as impressive. Fall Product LaunchesWhile much of the Microsoft news in recent weeks has been focused on the Xbox Project Scarlet, that game console won't be arriving until 2020. However, there are more product launches expected this fall, and they have potential upside for MSFT stock.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever The first is Project xCloud, the streaming gaming service set to take on Stadia from Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division. Project xCloud leverages all that Azure cloud hardware and it starts public testing this October. Cloud gaming has the potential to be huge. It may not just take a chunk of the current $138 billion global video game industry, it could significantly increase the size (and value) of the video game market by allowing consumers to play on devices like tablets and smartphones without the need for expensive consoles.Also expected this fall is new Surface hardware, including a new Surface Pro tablet. In Q3, MSFT's Personal Computing revenue was $10.7 billion and the biggest gains were Surface hardware revenue -- up 21%. Not in the Regulation SpotlightFinally, unlike virtually every other big tech company, government regulators don't appear to be taking aim at MSFT.It hasn't been singled out for skewing search results, sharing user data, influencing elections or running a monopoly. The company has already gone through antitrust proceedings, but that was several decades ago. With regulators increasingly looking at Apple, Amazon, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, MSFT is a relatively safe bet for investors who want to own a piece of a tech giant without a lot of risks.

2064,0.9938,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Slack Technologies Inc. couldn’t have picked a better time to go public. Investors have lost their minds about software companies.Earlier this year, I wrote about how stock buyers were willing to pay handsomely to own shares of fast-growing companies that sell cloud software to businesses. As investors had grown antsy about the FAANGs — the elite technology superpowers such as Apple Inc. and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. —  the software PUTIN stocks, as I semi-apologetically called them,(1)were ascendant. Since then, investors have warmly greeted new stock listings by even more business software firms including Zoom Video Communications Inc., Pagerduty Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.I went back to my self-selected cohort of 17 business software firms that included Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian and ServiceNow. The median stock multiple of my cohort, which I had to adjust slightly because of acquisitions, didn’t budge much since the February analysis.The median market value adjusted for cash and debt was about 10.3 times a blend of revenue estimated in the next year, compared with 9.8 times in February. The price-to-earnings multiple of the S&P 500 index has also increased since then.(5) What really stood out was the top-tier companies in my PUTIN index have grown even more bubbly.Look behind the velvet rope to find the 20x Club, the most popular hot spot in stock markets. More than half a dozen software firms now have enterprise values that are more than 20 times expected revenue in the next year, according to Bloomberg data.That is — to put it mildly — not normal. Relative to revenue, buying a share of pharmaceutical software firm Veeva Systems Inc., a member of the 20x Club, is four times the price of Alphabet, one of the dominant companies of this generation. Some of the members of the 20x Club are newly public, and it’s not unusual to see young companies with stock market values that are a bit out of whack. But 20x Club members also include Veeva, Atlassian Corp., Okta Inc., MongoDB and other companies that have been public for 18 months or more. As corporate-messaging service Slack plans to list its shares Thursday in a not-IPO,(2)it may join this elite crew. A valuation for Slack of $17 billion or so would work out to an enterprise value to forward revenue in the ballpark of the 20x Club.There are understandable reasons these business software firms, which are relatively unknown by normal humans, have become darlings of the stock market and technology investing. Something real and seemingly permanent is changing in how companies large and small buy technology. Companies are desperate to modernize their technology so they don’t get left behind and can take advantage of growth opportunities, and that has made them open their wallets to buy new types of internet-friendly, easy-to-use software that promises to help make their marketing spending more efficient, catch cyberattacks before they cripple systems or enable seamless communications among far-flung employees.I’m not yet convinced that these young cloud software companies can ever grow as large as their investors believe, particularly if an economic downturn forces companies to rationalize their technology budgets. But software truly is eating the world, and that has accrued to the benefit of both titans such as Microsoft and relative newcomers like the members of the 20x Club.At the same time, investors are desperate for growth, and business software firms are delivering it in spades. They can also be relatively easy to understand — they sell software in exchange for cash — and businesses have proved to be relatively reliable consumers, unlike people and their tendency to flit from one hot internet thing to the next. And now that superstar tech companies have run into regulatory problems, been hit with tariffs or otherwise have more question marks than before, a bet on a company selling software that an antitrust lawyer would never notice suddenly looks like a good idea. The question is what that promise costs. As stock buyers pay more relative to a company’s revenue, any wobble in growth can result in a crash, and investors’ room for error narrows when stock prices are already high relative to a company’s financial prospects. High stock valuations may also deter some needed consolidation in business software. It has become fashionable not to care about valuation, but there can be a high price to bubbles in share prices. Of course, I could have called a bubble in business software stocks at multiple points in the last decade and it would have been accurate in the moment yet completely wrong. An index of mostly business software companies, the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index, has more than quintupled since 2013, compared with a 74% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period. It’s true that 10 years into an unprecedented bull market in stocks, unusual valuations are par for the course. Maybe the bubble for business software firms will never end, or stock prices of these highflying software firms will deflate slowly rather than blow up. Maybe. Or there may be a high price to pay for software companies in an unprecedented stratosphere. (1) No, I am not sorry at all. I will say, however, that the &quot;U&quot; in PUTINs, Ultimate Software Group Inc., was sold in May to an investor group. My acronym is broken.(2) Yes, these software companies tend to be valued as a multiple of revenue rather than profits. In many cases they don't have profits.(3) Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg Opinion parent Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2068,-0.1775,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a coming daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Apple Inc. has asked its largest suppliers to consider the costs of shifting 15% to 30% of its output from China to Southeast Asia in a dramatic shake-up of its production chain, the Nikkei reported.The U.S. tech giant asked “major suppliers” to evaluate the feasibility of such a migration, the newspaper cited multiple sources as saying. Those included iPhone assemblers Foxconn Technology Group, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp., MacBook maker Quanta Computer Inc., iPad maker Compal Electronics Inc. and AirPod makers Inventec Corp., Luxshare-ICT and GoerTek Inc., Nikkei cited them as saying.China is a crucial cog in Apple’s business, the origin of most of its iPhones and iPads as well as its largest international market. But President Donald Trump has threatened Beijing with new tariffs on about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, an act that would escalate tensions while levying a punitive tax on Apple’s most profitable product. Company spokeswoman Wei Gu didn’t respond to a request for comment.Two major Apple suppliers pushed back against the Nikkei report. The U.S. company has not asked for cost estimates for shifting production out of the world’s No. 2 economy, although suppliers are running the numbers on their own given the trade dispute, said one person familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. Another supplier said it too had not gotten such a request from Apple and that the Cupertino, California-based company had resisted a proposed production shift to Southeast Asia.Apple does have a backup plan if the U.S.-China trade war gets out of hand: Primary manufacturing partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. has said it has enough capacity to make all U.S.-bound iPhones outside of China if necessary, Bloomberg News reported last week.The Taiwanese contract manufacturer now makes most of the smartphones in the Chinese mainland and is the country’s largest private employer. Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, has said Apple has not given instructions to move production but it is capable of moving lines elsewhere according to customers’ needs.Apple hasn’t set a deadline for the suppliers to finalize their business proposals, but is working together with them to consider alternative locations, the Nikkei said. Any move would be a long-term process, it cited its sources as saying.Beyond Apple’s partners, the army of Taiwanese companies that make most of the world’s electronics are reconsidering a reliance on the world’s second-largest economy as Washington-Beijing tensions simmer and massive tariffs threaten to wipe out their margins. That in turn is threatening a well-oiled, decades-old supply chain.Taiwan’s largest corporations form a crucial link in the global tech industry, assembling devices from sprawling Chinese production bases that the likes of HP Inc. and Dell then slap their labels on. That may start to change if tariffs escalate, an outcome now in the balance as Washington and Beijing spar over a trade deal.Apple is an outsized figure in that negotiation. The high-end iPhone, which accounted for more than 60% of the company’s 2018 revenue, drives millions of jobs across China as well as a plethora of different industries from retail to electronics. The country is also a major consumer market in its own right, yielding nearly 20% of last year’s revenue -- weakness there pushed Apple to cut its sales forecast in January.“Twenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we can help Apple respond to its needs in the U.S. market,” Hon Hai board nominee and semiconductor division chief Young Liu told an investor briefing in Taipei last week. “We have enough capacity to meet Apple’s demand.”(Updates with a source’s comments from the second parapraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.048,0.905,0.048,-1

2073,0.9795,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is trying harder than ever to convince investors of the potential for his many technology investments.At a general shareholders’ meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday, Son shared some predictions that were eye-popping even by the standards of the outspoken Japanese billionaire. The value of SoftBank’s investment portfolio could grow 33-fold to 200 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion) in 20 years, he said. That’s an annual growth rate of 19%. The numbers were so outlandish that Son had to add a caveat.“Let me be clear that this is not a business plan,” he said. “It’s a tall tale.”The gathering was SoftBank’s 39th shareholders meeting, with about 2,000 investors present. Son’s remarks drew laughs and even feigned outrage from directors. Fast Retailing Co. CEO Tadashi Yanai, who sits on SoftBank’s board and is Japan’s richest man, urged shareholders to look out for Son “or he will go out of control.”The billionaire’s projections include investments by the Vision Fund. But even bullish analysts have much more modest projections for that portfolio. Chris Lane of Sanford C. Bernstein recently estimated the net present value of the current and future funds at $50 billion to $85 billion.Son then reminded shareholders how 15 years ago at the very same auditorium he presented another seemingly improbable target -- SoftBank with 1 to 2 trillion yen in profit. At the time, the company booked over 100 billion yen in losses. Annual net income has exceeded 1 trillion yen for the past three years.Over that period of time, Son has expanded into wireless operations with the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s Japan unit, acquired Sprint Corp. in the U.S. and launched the $100 billion Vision Fund to transform SoftBank into a technology investment juggernaut. Still, the company trades at a deep discount to the worth of its holdings. The total value of the conglomerate’s publicly traded shareholdings is around 21 trillion yen, while SoftBank’s market cap is roughly 10.7 trillion yen. By the company’s own estimation, there is a discount of about 50%.Son’s message to investors is that when it comes to technology, he is ahead of the curve. He was early to recognize the value of e-commerce and invest in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. SoftBank was also first to introduce Apple Inc.’s iPhone in Japan. Now Son believes the world is on the verge of another technological shift, driven by artificial intelligence that will transform every industry. He argues that the company’s portfolio of unicorns from Uber Technologies Inc. to WeWork Cos. positions SoftBank to reap the most benefits from that disruption.“I wish I had the money to make tons of investments at the start of the internet revolution. I could see it coming,” Son said. “We started the Vision Fund at the very beginning of the AI revolution.”At least a few of the investors present took him at his word.“Son may talk big, but just look at what he has actually accomplished,” said Yasuhiro Suzuki, a SoftBank shareholder of about 20 years. “I have been to many of these meetings, but today Son seemed especially in high spirits.”Key Insights:The Vision Fund is nearing the end of its investment cycle and SoftBank is in the process of raising a second one of equal size, Son said. The two funds will be successive. SoftBank is in talks with limited partners in the first fund to renew their investments.The company is increasing staff at the fund to 1,000 people, from 415 now.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.013,0.913,0.074,1

He recognized that this created opportunities that were being overlooked by Wall Street -- particularly the ability of software to measure risk tolerances and figure out an appropriate asset allocation. In his class in entrepreneurial finance, Stein used the idea of an online automated investment adviser as his case study. The feedback allowed him to enhance many of the financial services now offered by Betterment.In our conversation, he explains how the industry has changed since he started the company, notably the acquisition costs of finding new customers. We also discuss some of Betterment’s online competitors.

2100,0.988,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. made a renewed push into payments on Tuesday, announcing plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra.Read More: Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to One Day Rival the GreenbackIt will be governed by the Libra Association, a group of companies that will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. Almost 30 firms have joined and Facebook hopes another 70 or more will enter the fold in the future.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper hereWho’s In:Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., the world’s largest payments networks, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc. are on board. For Visa and Mastercard, it’s a chance to offer the world of cryptocurrencies the same services they provide in card payments. All three companies know the challenges of building a network and can offer expertise in encouraging consumers to use the instrument and cajoling merchants into accepting it.Companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Spotify Technology SA keep millions of credit cards on file, and they risk losing customers when people get a new card or number. E-commerce firms also pay higher “card not present” rates when processing payments, so anything that can reduce these expenses is welcome.“Libra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology, while reducing the costs for everyone,” said Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments at Uber.International companies, including e-commerce firm MercadoLibre Inc. and telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc, signed onto Libra, too. Blockchain technology and stablecoins are potential solutions for the messy world of cross-border payments, which suffers from delays and high costs.Who’s Out:Large banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., already have their own payments businesses that reap billions of dollars in fees. With regulators still deciding how to treat cryptocurrencies, banks and investment firms are treading cautiously.So far, no large brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., are taking part. The industry is always interested in lowering the cost of accepting payments, but traditional merchants have historically been hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies due to volatility and lack of consumer adoption.The largest U.S. technology companies, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc., are noticeably absent. Many of these firms have their own digital payments businesses and some are experimenting with blockchain technology. Apple has poured scorn on Facebook for repeated privacy missteps and other big tech firms are trying to avoid being associated with the social-media giant.“This is very early -- 27 organizations right now, 100 by the time we launch,” David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And by that time, I definitely expect to see banks in there, I definitely expect to see other large technology companies and I definitely expect to see more diversity of organizations in terms of geographical distribution.”Square Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is a cryptocurrency fan, but even his firm isn’t part of Libra at launch.

2103,0.99,"(Bloomberg) -- If Facebook Inc.’s new digital currency goes according to plan, it could one day compete with payment giants Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. But for now, all three are set to work with the social-media company on the venture.The currency, called Libra, will launch as soon as next year. It’s what’s known as a stablecoin, one that can avoid massive fluctuations in value so it can be used for everyday transactions. Industry experts and insiders say the payments companies want a seat at the table to help shape the new currency.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper here“It’s not unusual for the incumbents -- Visa, Mastercard, PayPal -- to partner with a disruptor,” Harshita Rawat, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in an interview. “They would at least want to participate in how this product is being developed.”New payment methods such as Apple Pay and other mobile wallets are often slow to take off, so any competition is likely to be years away. Still, the earlier payments companies come to the project, the more time they have to ensure their businesses don’t suffer.None of these companies has been shy about pursuing collaboration or other strategic opportunities. PayPal alone has spent billions of dollars buying or investing in potential partnerships as well as competitors. While PayPal hasn’t ventured into cryptocurrencies before, it was a proponent of the blockchain technology that will be used to build Libra.Visa and Mastercard are always looking to embed themselves in emerging payment forms. Both have developed partnerships with cryptocurrency and blockchain firms. They’ve said that Libra can help more people gain access to financial products.“We think cryptocurrencies can address use cases that are not really well served today,” such as areas where cash-based payments remain prominent, said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president of digital solutions at Mastercard. “As such we think it will be incremental to what we do and not a replacement of it.”The payment companies are part of the Libra Association, giving them a say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. There’s currently no time commitment, so members can leave at any time. Once the group’s charter is finalized, there will be a minimum time commitment, according to some members of the group who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.“My sense is that they will try their best to partner and engage with Facebook,” Rawat said. “If Facebook takes the angle that they want to disintermediate card payments, then I think they may not want to participate.”Facebook shares rose 1.4% to $191.61 as of 11:12 a.m. in New York after announcing the cryptocurrency venture.(Updates with shares in final paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Dan Reichl, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.022,0.871,0.108,1

2106,0.9951,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Facebook Inc. on Tuesday launched its ambitious new cryptocurrency, which targets 2.6 billion users and is backed by up to $1 billion in funds. For the blockchain faithful, there was plenty of the usual stuff you see in these kinds of projects: A white paper, a nonprofit consortium to govern the digital coins, geeky technical details on how transactions will be validated, and the promise of open-source code.But for consumers, who will decide ultimately whether or not Libra is a flop, there was only a slightly underwhelming hint of what it might actually be used for: A picture of someone sending money to someone else via a smartphone.Even setting aside the various risks thrown up by the Libra white paper (financial stability, user privacy, and whether it could cope with hundreds of millions of daily transactions), you have to ask why it might be a compelling product. The service described by Facebook, namely sending money “as you might send a text message,” is already offered by plenty of other companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Cash, PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo and Circle, a peer-to-peer payments provider that lets you transfer traditional fiat currencies.Indeed, Facebook itself lets you send cash through its Messaging app. The company even had its own virtual currency before, called Credits, for the purchasing of content from within apps. It didn’t take off.Libra’s sales pitch says that “in time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, like paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.” It’s true that you can’t do that on every payments app. But Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg faces plenty of competition in the race toward a cashless society, with other corporate and government rivals already well advanced in their plans. Sweden, for example, is on the road to becoming cashless as soon as 2023. The local mobile payments service Swish was used by about 60 percent of Swedes in 2018, according to a Riksbank survey. It has more than 6.7 million users in the country.This isn’t to write off Facebook’s chances completely. Maybe its financial heft and vast number of users could turn something that’s already pretty convenient today (money transfers and payments) into something ultra-convenient. Imagine a pot of Libra tokens that could pay directly for every goods purchase or app subscription without the need for any currency conversion or card payment. This would, though, depend on Facebook’s ability to manage the huge technical challenge of designing a single coin that can be used truly anywhere.To become a genuinely universal medium of exchange, the company would need to get rival tech giants like Amazon.Com Inc. and Netflix Inc. on board. And why would they want to do Zuckerberg any favors? The idea that Libra is really at arm’s length from his social media empire of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is debatable. Facebook plans to lead the Libra consortium for the rest of 2019, and it will be at least five years before the blockchain technology that supports the tokens is completely decentralized. The ultimate dream of any crypto project worth its salt is that the digital currency doesn’t rely on a single point of control. But even if Facebook manages to get there, does Zuckerberg really want to embrace the dangers of a Wild West cryptocurrency? Bitcoin is a lesson here.And what about Facebook’s targeting of the “unbanked,” or those in the developing world struggling with volatile currencies? Bitcoin and its ilk promised to address the same problems, and have failed completely to help anyone other than speculators and criminals.Zuckerberg’s own patchy record on international payments should give pause too. WhatsApp Pay has struggled to gain regulatory acceptance in India, the world’s top remittance market, because its data storage practices didn’t meet national standards. Libra will have to answer a lot of similar questions about its financial structure and treatment of customer information.Facebook has been on a mission over the past year to recapture the trust of its users. Libra certainly demands a lot of faith.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

2109,0.9994,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. unveiled plans for a new, global financial system with a broad group of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. on board to create a cryptocurrency it expects will one day trade much like the U.S. dollar and inject a new source of revenue.Called Libra, the new currency will launch as soon as next year and be what's known as a stablecoin–a digital currency that's supported by established government-backed currencies and securities. The goal is to avoid massive fluctuations in value so Libra can be used for everyday transactions across Facebook in a way that more volatile cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, haven’t been. The project is the culmination of a year-long effort as Facebook seeks to spur growth on its various platforms that already count more than 2 billion users. But it will also likely face skepticism–from regulators who already think Facebook has too much power and plays loose with digital privacy, and from those that are dubious of cryptocurrencies, which are known more for speculative investments and blackmarket commerce than for legitimate financial transactions.Read Facebook's white paper on Project Libra here.If successful, Libra could make Facebook a much bigger player in financial services.  Cryptocurrency firms have been trying to build cross-border, digital currencies on the blockchain to disrupt traditional banking and payments for a decade, but nothing has caught on at the scale of traditional money yet.Facebook, which announced the project with 27 partners, is already under wide-ranging regulatory scrutiny over how it handles users’ private data. Growth of its main platform has plateaued in some major markets and crypto payments would be a way to turn messaging – across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram -- into a business that complements its advertising operation, which generates almost all of its revenue. Facebook shares gained early Tuesday as analysts saw the move as a potentially major new profit stream. “We view Facebook’s introduction of the Libra currency as a potential watershed moment for the company and global adoption of crypto,” wrote Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who has an outperform rating and $250 price target on Facebook shares. “In terms of scale and importance, we believe this new financial infrastructure could be viewed similar to Apple’s introduction of iOS to developers over a decade ago.”Still, the announcement was met immediately with political opposition in Europe, with calls for tighter regulation of the company. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Libra shouldn’t be seen as a replacement for traditional currencies and called on the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on the project for their July meeting.“It is out of question’’ that Libra “become a sovereign currency,’’ Le Maire said in an interview on Europe 1 radio. “It can’t and it must not happen.”Read More: Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Project: Who’s In and Who’s OutFacebook Could Be for Crypto What AOL Was for Internet Adoption Crypto Chiefs Novogratz, Allaire Say Facebook Coin Bullish SignFacebook Rallies as Analysts Praise 'Watershed' Crypto Move France Calls for Central Bank Review of Facebook CryptocurrencyTo come anywhere close to matching the U.S. dollar for utility and acceptance, Libra will need to be widely trusted. So Facebook and its partners are mimicking how other currencies have been introduced in the past.“To help instill trust in a new currency and gain widespread adoption during its infancy, it was guaranteed that a country’s notes could be traded in for real assets, such as gold,” the companies wrote in a white paper. “Instead of backing Libra with gold, though, it will be backed by a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.&quot;The total number of Libra can change, and new digital coins can be issued whenever someone wants to exchange their Libra for an existing fiat currency, so the price shouldn’t fluctuate any more than other stable currencies, according to David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project.“It would make a scenario where there’s a run on the bank completely impossible, because we are backed one-for-one,” he said. Libra will also be audited, he added, an important step in an industry with limited transparency.Facebook has closely guarded its crypto plans for more than a year, though many of the details have already been reported by Bloomberg News and other outlets.Read about how Marcus tapped PayPal talent to build Facebook’s blockchain team.Marcus, who used to run Facebook Messenger, said Facebook plans to build a new digital wallet that will exist inside Messenger and its other standalone messaging service, WhatsApp. Once Libra is up and running, the currency and the digital wallet should make it easier for people to send money to friends, family and businesses through the apps. Libra will run on the so-called blockchain, a database that can use millions of computers to verify transactions, eliminating risks that come with information being held centrally by a single entity. Facebook created a new subsidiary, called Calibra, to build the new wallet and focus on the company’s blockchain efforts.Facebook's track record in payments and commerce has been spotty. A few years ago, it began letting people buy flowers or hail an Uber through its Messenger service. Those features have not been huge hits. In 2010, it began offering Facebook Credits, a way to buy virtual goods inside Facebook games. But in 2012 it scrapped Credits, and in 2013 it started working with third-party services like PayPal process some payments. Facebook's revenue from &quot;payments and other service&quot; was less than 2% of total sales in 2018. When it finally arrives, Libra will be late to a party that’s been going on so long, many of the party-goers have either left or collapsed. Some past attempts to make coins usable for commerce, such as Bitcoin, haven’t widely caught on yet because price volatility mainly attracted traders and speculators. Predecessor stablecoins, like Tether, have been used by some traders to park funds in during times of high volatility, but have not been broadly adopted for commerce.Read more about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s early plans for cryptocurrency. U.S. regulations may represent another hurdle for Facebook. Creating a digital currency doesn’t just require buy-in from financial institutions who need to accept it, and consumers who need to trust it, but it requires approval from regulators, too. The Securities and Exchange Commission has shut down about a dozen businesses issuing their own tokens for violations of securities law. Marcus said Facebook has been in contact with regulators and central banks, but added that the company hasn’t received a “no-action” letter from the SEC yet. That would have safeguarded the project from regulatory action by the agency.One way Facebook hopes to appease regulators is through the Libra Association, a governing body tasked with making decisions about Libra. Firms including Visa and PayPal Holdings Inc. are part of the group. Marcus described these members as “co-founders,” and said they will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed.“Facebook will not have any special privilege or special voting rights at the association level,” said Marcus, the former president of PayPal. “We will have competitors and other players on top of this platform that will build competing wallets and services.”All Libra Association members are putting a minimum of $10 million into a reserve to help support the cryptocurrency’s value. This buy-in comes with voting privileges. However, the association’s governance structure is still in flux, and most of the group’s crucial decisions, including the creation of its charter, have not yet been decided, according to several members of the group. They asked not to be identified discussing private details.“Facebook will not have any special privilege”Libra’s timing could also pose challenges. Facebook is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission over the company’s privacy practices. Some have called for the company to be broken up, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Asking consumers to put more trust in the social media giant, and giving Facebook a strong entry into the world of digital payments and banking, will likely draw further criticism.Opinion: Crypto-evangelists hoped digital currencies would challenge Big Tech’s data control. Zuckerberg has other plans.The company plans to keep financial data gathered from Libra users separate from Facebook user data. That’s why Facebook’s digital wallet will exist under the Calibra subsidiary, which will house user transaction data on separate servers, Marcus said. If a WhatsApp user uses her Calibra wallet to send money to a friend or pay a retailer, those interactions won’t be stored alongside her social-media profile.“There’s a clear distinction between Calibra and what Calibra has access to, and what Facebook Inc. has access to,” Marcus said. “It’s very clear that people don’t want their financial data from an account to be comingled with social data or to be used for other purposes.”(Updates with analyst comment, French finance minister, and shares.)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Surane.To contact the authors of this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netOlga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netJulie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.021,0.853,0.126,1

2112,0.9996,"At the start of this decade, there were some concerns that the innovation curve at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was falling flat, and that the company was growing stale, resting on its laurels, and becoming increasingly irrelevant in a rapidly changing big tech landscape. As a result, there was something of a lackluster enthusiasm for Microsoft stockSource:  Johannes Marliem Via FlickrThen, just over seven years ago, in February 2014, Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft. He promised change. Specifically, he promised to shift Microsoft's focus to cloud services, and in so doing, returning Microsoft not just to big tech relevancy, but once again make Microsoft one of the most important companies in the world.He's done just that. Microsoft is once again one of the largest companies in the world, and its stock has risen 250% since early 2014.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWill this big rally in MSFT stock continue? Yes. For four very simple reasons.  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less  Four Reasons to Love Microsoft StockFirst, the big cloud pivot isn't over just yet, and Microsoft's many cloud businesses continue to fire on all cylinders.Second, every other business at Microsoft continues to move in the right direction, and make revenue and profit gains.Third, the company is side-stepping big tech regulation which is threatening other tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).Fourth, the valuation underlying MSFT stock remains reasonable relative to long term growth prospects.Net net, cloud growth plus tangential business growth will drive continued revenue and profit growth over the next several years. The lack of a regulation threat means that this growth trajectory has tremendous clarity. At the same time, the valuation is reasonable enough to allow for that growth to drive healthy share price gains.The takeaway? Stick with Microsoft stock for the long run. The Cloud Business Is Firing on All CylindersThe first, and most important, reason to stick with MSFT stock is that the company and stock's biggest driver - the cloud business - remains on fire.The cloud pivot has been the core of Microsoft stock's big 250% rally since early 2014. This pivot is far from over. Last quarter, commercial cloud revenue rose more than 40%. That's a big growth rate. It won't head much lower anytime soon. Only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud. That number will move towards 100% in the long run, meaning that the global cloud market still has a long runway for growth.Further, Microsoft continues to innovate and expand share in that market, meaning Microsoft cloud growth rates should continue to outpace cloud market growth rates. Thus, with Microsoft, you have a leading cloud player that's growing share in the secular growth cloud market. Ultimately, that means Microsoft's cloud business will continue to fire off 20%-plus growth quarters for a lot longer. All Other Businesses Are Moving in the Right DirectionAlthough the core cloud businesses steal the spotlight at Microsoft, the company's other businesses are actually doing very well, and will continue to support higher prices for the stock.On the gaming front, Microsoft just announced its next-gen Xbox console, dubbed &quot;Project Scarlett&quot;, which is set to be four times more powerful than its predecessor, the Xbox One X. Microsoft is also testing the waters in the cloud gaming world with its &quot;Project xCloud&quot; video game streaming service.Meanwhile, on the office products front, Microsoft just incorporated real-time financial data into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, a move that could help offset the subtle migration from Microsoft Excel to Google Sheets.At the same time, LinkedIn has continued to expand its reach in the business networking world, and Microsoft's PC business has made steady share gains thanks to the huge popularity of the Surface.All in all, it isn't just Microsoft's cloud business which is doing really well right now. All of Microsoft's businesses are doing well. The Company Is Side-Stepping Big Tech RegulationImportantly, Microsoft does not have the regulation risks which are weighing on fellow big tech stocks.There are five big tech stocks in the U.S. which have $500 billion-plus market caps - Microsoft ($1 trillion market cap), Amazon ($930 billion), Apple ($900 billion), Alphabet ($760 billion), and Facebook ($535 billion). Of those five big tech giants, Microsoft is the only one not being probed by either the FTC or DoJ for anti-competitive reasons.From a market psychology perspective, that's a big deal. Investors with Amazon/Apple/Alphabet/Facebook exposure may not want that exposure anymore because of the regulatory risks, but because the tech growth narrative remains vigorous, those investors will still want big tech exposure. Where can they get big tech exposure without the regulation headwind? Microsoft is the only place.Consequently, we could see a migration of investment dollars from other big techs stocks to MSFT stock as regulation headwinds build. Valuation Remains ReasonableLastly, the valuation underlying Microsoft remains reasonable relative to the company's long term growth prospects.Microsoft stock trades around 29-times forward earnings. That's as rich as the valuation has been in the past decade. But, growth is also as big as its been in the past decade. According to Street estimates, profits are expected to rise 18% this year, 11% next year, and 15% the following year.In other words, Microsoft projects as a steady double-digit profit grower over the next several years, and that growth has tremendous visibility thanks to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market and the lack of regulation risks. A near 30-times forward multiple for that magnitude of growth and that level of growth clarity seems reasonable. Bottom Line on Microsoft StockMicrosoft stock has been a big winner for the past seven years. It will continue to be a winner over the next several years, too, because the cloud business remains on the fire, the company's other businesses are doing well, the growth trajectory has tremendous clarity, and the valuation remains reasonable.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, AMZN, AAPL, and GOOG.

2115,0.9972,"Visa (NYSE:V) is up more than 25% over the past year, stoked in part by Federal Reserve rate hikes of 2018 that have translated into higher profit margins for credit card companies. The overall fundamental strength of the company has also been the catalyst behind the Visa stock returns.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrThe world's largest retail electronic payments network, Visa, is expected to report earnings in late July. There could be some volatility and profit-taking in Visa in the coming weeks, especially as many other financial services firms also report in July.However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add Visa stock to their portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today  Long-Term Visa Stock StrengthsRobust Fundamental Numbers: Visa is a quality blue-chip company with a $370 billion market cap. Since going public in 2008, Visa has rewarded shareholders continuously.The group does not issue credit cards or lend money. Instead, the company operates as an &quot;intermediary,&quot; charging a fee on each of the 150 million transactions its network handles every day.Visa has three sources of revenue:  * Service revenues (for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products);  * Data processing revenues (fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, or clearing); and  * International transaction revenues (for cross-border and currency conversion transactions).On April 24, Visa posted better than expected results for Q2 2019. Revenue for the quarter ending March 31 was $5.5 billion, an 8% growth year-over-year (YoY).Earnings per share (EPS) also increased to $1.31, a 17% YoY increase. As a result of robust growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, the company also increased its outlook for the year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at over 54%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.6, compared to the industry average of 2.4.In fact, Visa and its long-time archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) can be said to have a duopoly in the cards network sector. Both companies collect transaction fees for without bearing credit risk and control a majority of the digital payment infrastructure. And there does not seem to be much threat to the dominance of either company.Visa's sales numbers are forecast to grow over 10% in 2019 and 2020. Overall, Wall Street expects Visa's profitability, high margins, robust cash flow and healthy financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for a purchase with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta as well as It's currently bidding to buy Earthport,a British payments company, that facilitates money transfer services across borders.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 28%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Leading up to its earnings report in late July, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks and even have a pullback toward the low-$160's or even mid-$150's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.98, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, Visa may also be adversely affected.Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in these tech stocks.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.Current shareholders may also consider hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $180.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.If there are mixed earnings reports or important news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in the stock. For example, if any of Visa peers were to issue an earnings warning, due to a potential slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. or globally, then Visa shares could also be adversely affected in the near-term.However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night.In general, whenever Visa stock price has a correction, such as the one it experienced in late 2018, the shares come back rather quickly, only to make a new high in several months. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, profitability, leadership in the respective market, stability, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.There are two important secular trends currently affecting the payments sector in the U.S. as well as many other countries, i.e., payment transactions are increasingly moving to mobile and digital payments are surpassing cash payments. As the industry is growing and being transformed, Visa stock may indeed provide a solid long-term investment for many shareholders.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, there are some concerns the Array deal could be credit negative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCredit ratings aside, traditional pharmaceuticals companies need growth, and buying makers of cancer drugs is one avenue for delivering that growth. Other ChatterApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, always a widely watched bellwether as it is the largest technology name in the Dow, traded modestly higher Monday although some analysts expressed concern about the impact of the China trade war on the stock and how the company is positioned for a fuller 5G rollout next year.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today &quot;JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee cut his forecast for iPhone shipments for the next few quarters by 4%, and trimmed his price target on the stock to $233 from $235,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;But he maintains an Overweight rating on the shares, asserting that the trade tensions are likely to be resolved.&quot;Sticking with Dow technology names for a moment, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the largest semiconductor makers, is trying to snap out of a funk that has the stock down nearly 15% in the current quarter. Much of that tumble is attributable to semiconductor companies' sensitivity to the trade war with China, but for long-term investors, there are reasons to be optimistic about Intel.&quot;We concede that 2019 will be strenuous for Intel because of macro weakness, U.S.-China tensions, and share loss, but overall revenue growth should eventually stabilize,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;As Intel gets back on track in 2020 with its 10-nm Ice Lake server parts, we think its data center group, or DCG, will enjoy average top-line growth of 10% through 2023.&quot;Boeing (NYSE:BA), a frequent guest in this space and the Dow's largest component, was the blue-chip index's best performer Monday, adding 2.2%.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOverall, a little under half of the Dow's 30 components closed higher today, hardly a great percentage and risks remain for investors to consider. Looking out to later in June, FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on June 25, and while the freight shipping company is not a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it is a member of the Dow Jones Transportation Index, and a bellwether stock at that.Mired in a slump that has seen the shares slide almost 5% this month, FedEx stock lost another half percent Monday after JPMorgan lowered its price target on the stock to $184 from $202. Tennessee-based FedEx has been a guidance offender multiple times over the past year and it appears that bad news is poised to continue.Again, FedEx is not a Dow stock, nor is it the largest company in the U.S. Not even close, but transportation names are historically accurate gauges of economic sentiment the market's tolerance for risk so there could be some tests coming for stocks before June ends.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Today, let's look instead at components that are ready for an upside move. Here are four to watch:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Dow Jones Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are pushing higher, testing above their 50-day moving average and looking longingly at the $200-a-share level lost back in early May. Now, the company is vulnerable to a worsening of the U.S.-China trade standoff. It could potentially get hit in both directions: first on a risk to its China-centered supply chain and second, with its image as an American tech giant in the eyes of Chinese consumers. However, hype is also building for the launch of the iPhone 11 later this year. Further, the company is looking to introduce two 5G phones in 2020.The company will next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.10 per share on revenues of $53.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $2.46 per share beat estimates by 10 cents on a 5.1% decline in revenues. Boeing (BA)After months of malaise following two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX, a resulting regulatory grounding, and long-term damage to the company's image, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares have stabilized. They now look ready for a possible push back above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. At some point, all the bad news gets priced in. The latest reports are that the FAA is expected to soon begin flight trials of the fix for the 737 MAX.The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.81 per share on revenues of $19.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $3.16 missed estimates by three cents on a 2% drop in revenues. Disney (DIS)Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares are threatening to push up and over their prior high from late April, aiming for new record highs. Analysts at Citigroup recently upgraded the stock and assigned a $160-a-share price target, a move that would be worth a gain of nearly 15% from here. A successful opening for the new Toy Story 4 movie would help motivate such a move.The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.77 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on May 8, earnings of $1.61 beat estimates by four cents on a 2.6% rise in revenues. Home Depot (HD)Shares of home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are threatening to break up and out of a two-year long consolidation range with a push above the $210-a-share level. Lower long-term interest rates in recent months is helping reverse a slowdown in the U.S. housing market, with the company benefiting form the pickup in activity as both buyers and sellers focus on everything from new appliances to gardening.The company will next report results on Aug. 20 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.09 per share on revenues of $31 billion. When the company last reported on May 21, earnings of $2.27 beat estimates by eight cents on a 5.7% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While the stock is up about 12% from a low hit earlier this month, Apple is still down more than 8% from a peak in early May.JPMorgan wrote that macroeconomic uncertainty “is likely to drive greater headwinds to the smartphone market.” The bank lowered its iPhone shipment forecasts for the second quarter through the fourth quarter, dropping them by 4% to 139.5 million units. Analyst Samik Chatterjee also trimmed his price target by $2 to $233, although he kept his overweight rating.The macro issues are “cyclical and likely resolved with a trade resolution,” Chatterjee wrote, adding that Apple could see a tailwind from its growing services business.The iPhone is critically important to Apple’s fortunes, accounting for more than 60% of the company’s 2018 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company derived nearly 20% of last year’s revenue from China, and weakness there pushed Apple to cut its sales forecast in January.JPMorgan was not the only firm to express caution about the outlook for iPhone sales on Monday. Longbow Research wrote that “concerns are rising that the ban on sales to Huawei will further impair iPhone demand in China,” and that there was a risk Apple “will not see notable share gains outside of China.” Analyst Shawn Harrison has a neutral rating on Apple, and wrote that the company’s efforts “to expand the reach and breadth of its services is key amidst a challenged iPhone demand environment, particularly in China.”Loop Capital Markets wrote that while iPhone unit demand was “well aligned with Street expectations” for June, consensus forecasts were “too high” for the second half of the year.“We continue to believe that risk remains to iPhone revenue through the year from mix (both units and capacity per unit), but with a stabilizing China,” analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, affirming Loop’s hold rating and $190 price target.A more optimistic view on the iPhone came from Credit Suisse, which wrote that China iPhone sales were becoming “less bad.”“The pace of decline for iPhone shipments in China has significantly improved” so far this quarter, analyst Matthew Cabral wrote, touting the impact of price cuts. But he noted that units were still down 4% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, and that iPhones were “lagging the overall Chinese smartphone market.”While “less bad” is a “clear positive given the magnitude of the prior headwind, risk remains,” he wrote. Credit Suisse has a neutral rating and $209 price target.Cabral expects trade-related uncertainty will keep the stock within a range, but that risks are “skewed to the downside.”Even beyond trade, he added that “aggressive local competition and a narrower ecosystem advantage in China remain deeper structural challenges for Apple, with no easy near-term fix.”To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",0.072,0.85,0.078,1

The FTC's mission statement conveys a focus on &quot;preventing anti-competitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitimate business activity&quot; and mentions that the agency is &quot;the only federal agency with both consumer protection and competition jurisdiction in broad sectors of the economy.&quot; To Martin, this mission means that the company &quot;can look into almost anything it wants to in any industry it wants to&quot; and can &quot;pivot and look at a different potential infraction&quot; if it doesn't find anything in one area. The FTC also has public hearings, which could bring negative attention to Facebook, while peers Alphabet and Apple are now under the eye of the DOJ, which runs a closed investigative process.

2199,0.9998,"The voices are growing louder that the US economy is starting to sputter. From Morgan Stanley, stock strategist Michael Wilson said last month, “Recent data points suggest US earnings and economic risk is greater than most investors may think,” and the May jobs report, released on June 7, backed him up. The numbers were grim, with only 75,000 new jobs reported for the month, and the previous two months revised down by an equal amount. Other data has shown a slowdown in the services sector, and a nine-year low in manufacturing activity.The data is starting to point towards trouble, but the real problem with protecting your portfolio in a downturn lies in the lagging definition of a recession: two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Given that growth data is typically reported one month after the fact, this means that investors will always be 4 to 7 months late in taking protective measures. So, let’s be proactive about this, and take a look at TipRanks’ database to find some reliable stocks for defensive investing. These are not necessarily “classic” defensive stocks; rather, these companies have shown by recent performance that they can deliver profits even in a downturn.  Apple, Inc. (AAPL)First on our list today is Apple, partly because these days it seems you just can’t build a portfolio without a tech giant but mostly because Apple has proven both its long-term reliability and its short-term resiliency. For the long term, Apple is up 130% in the last five years, while in the short haul the company recovered well from the Q4 2018 downturn and has already made up more than half the losses from last month’s market swoon.More importantly, Apple has also shown that it can adapt and change. Steve Jobs’ unique vision underlay his company’s growth in the early 2000s, and his death in 2011 prompted fears that his successor, Tim Cook, would not fill his shoes and the company would stagnate. It is fair to say that events of the past three quarters have laid that fear to rest. While Cook is not Jobs, he hasn’t needed to be – he took over a mature company with established niches and a growing customer base. He has shown himself fully capable of meeting the challenges the market has posed.Cook met last year’s market dip head-on. He admitted that Apple’s core iPhone sales were not going to fully recover, and orchestrated a plan to meet the changing conditions by shifting the sales focus to Services, reconciling iPhone to a longer replacement cycle, and promoting the iPad, iMac, and Macbook lines. Under all of this, helping to ensure success, is the near-billion strong loyal customer base that the company has built over the past decade.So, Apple has the solid foundation that every defensive stock needs. Looking forward, the company made a favorable impression on market analysts earlier this month at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Kathryn Huberty (Track Record & Ratings) of Morgan Stanley said after Apple’s presentation, “After (Monday’s) announcements, we believe Apple Watch and Mac will more meaningfully contribute to App Store growth, while further solidifying Apple as the most attractive platform for app developers.” Noting the company’s commitment to increasing its Services sector, she added, “Apple's top growth opportunity is driving increased user engagement with apps.” Huberty gives Apple a buy rating with a $231 price target, seeing an upside of 19%.Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson (Track Record & Ratings) also gives Apple high ratings. Peering into the future of iPhone, he notes that 20% of current owners are interested in upgrading to 5G, and says, “Interest in 5G will only grow from here, so this is a favorable early sign that 5G is viewed as a key feature… we believe that as long as services revenue continues to perform well, it will tide many investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones intensifies.” His price target on AAPL, $230, also suggests an 19% upside.The analyst consensus on AAPL shares is a ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 19 buy ratings, 16 holds, 2 sells given over the last three months. Shares are trading at $192, so the $212 average price target indicates an upside of 10%.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)This one is a traditional defensive stock, and it has a reputation for being a bit staid, but don’t let that fool you: Johnson & Johnson offers real value, consistently delivering on both dividend and long-term equity growth. Both are markers of a strong defensive play.The company’s current dividend yield is 2.72%, which may seem small, but at current share prices it equates to an annual payout of $3.80. Better than the actual dividend payment, however, is JNJ’s dividend history. The company has been paying, and steadily increasing, its dividend since the early 1970s. This policy of consistently rewarding shareholders provides a steady source of income for investors, and also encourages them to reinvest that income in the company. It’s a win-win policy.As a long-term investment, JNJ has, like Apple, proven its worth. The stock has gained 56% in the last 5 years, and shows a 9% gain over the past 12 months. And also like Apple, JNJ has proven resilient in the face of adversity: last December, the stock took a hard hit from bad press related to the widely reported talcum powder recall, but has since regained most of that loss. In another example of corporate resiliency, JNJ was recently given a buy rating with a $157 price target by five-star analyst Joanne Wuensch (Track Record & Ratings) of BMO Capital, after she reviewed the status of current legal action the company faced in the state of Oklahoma in regard to the opioid abuse epidemic. Wuensch notes that the case will likely be resolved quickly, and points out, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” Her price target indicates confidence in the stock, and a 12% upside.Johnson & Johnson’s success rests on two separate bases. The first, and most widely recognized, is the company’s array of popular consumer brands. JNJ is the producer of Band-Aids, Listerine, and Tylenol, to name just a few. Consumer products provide a respectable 16.7% of annual revenue (nearly $14 billion), but the real money for JNJ lies in pharmaceuticals. To put it in perspective, two drugs – Remicade and Simponi – account for 11.3% of the company’s total revenues, two-thirds as much as all of the consumer products.Unlike many large-scale drug producers, Johnson & Johnson is not deeply exposed to payment issues with the Medicare and Medicaid systems. This is important for investors, as both programs have reputations for underpaying, and with an election year coming up both programs are likely to become political footballs as candidates promise ever more benefits. This is a key point noted by Terence Flynn (Track Record & Ratings). Writing for Goldman Sachs, Flynn says, “The company has the lowest exposure to Medicare/Medicaid within the group. As a result, the stock will be less impacted by potential drug pricing headlines/policy proposals ahead of the 2020 presidential election.” Flynn sets a price target of $163 for JNJ, suggesting an upside of 16%.JNJ’s consensus rating of ‘Moderate Buy’ is derived from 7 buy and 5 hold reviews. The stock’s $149 average price target and $140 share price equate to an upside potential of 7%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)Fast food burgers might not come immediately to mind when you hear the phrase ‘Return on Investment,’ but McDonald’s has been delivering more than just quick eats. The company has gained an impressive 16% so far this year, rising from $176 on January 2 to a closing price of $205 on June 14. Even more impressive, between May 3 and June 3, while the S&P 500 was slipping 6.8%, MCD shares were gaining 1.2%.It’s all part of a steady-growth story going back to May of 2015, when current CEO Steve Easterbrook took over. McD’s had just posted its first sales decline in more than a decade, and the new chief’s mandate was simple: refresh a stale brand. His ‘Turnaround Plan’ got the company back to basics, emphasizing fresher, higher quality ingredients; a streamlined menu; and physical rebuilding efforts in the company’s aging franchise locations. Through it all, McDonald’s has maintained its high dividend; the payout is now $4.64 annually, for a yield of 2.26%.The market’s analysts agree that MCD is on a stable upward path. Writing at BTIG, Peter Saleh (Track Record & Ratings) says, “The company's menu strategy shift has boosted comps. Expect the increased menu focus on bundles and full price items – and away from deep discounts - to drive higher U.S. average check for the next couple of quarters.” Saleh boosted his price target to $220 on MCD, suggesting an upside of 7%.Saleh’s not alone. Weighing in from Merrill Lynch last week, Gregory Francfort (Track Record & Ratings) sees “2Q-4Q same-store sales (including 3.9%-4.2% for the U.S.) looking conservative with more upside potential than downside risk.” Like Saleh, he gives MCD a $220 price target.Overall, MCD has a ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus based on 19 analyst ratings given in the last three months, including 14 buys and 5 holds. The stock sells for $205 as of June 14, and the average price target of $216 indicates an upside potential of 5.5%.View MCD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW)If the US economy does turn down to recession, Lowe’s is in an excellent position to take advantage of the changed conditions. The do-it-yourself home improvement supplier operates on the big-box model, using bulk to offer discounts on the products and services that, in bad times, homeowners are more likely to handle as DIY.This puts Lowe’s strength as a defensive play is in its niche – the stores offer products that most people need, at discounts that grow more attractive in a downturn. Home maintenance won’t stop for a recession, and DIY really is a good way to save money. In addition, Lowe’s has maintained its lucrative contractor business.And now we get to the weakness in this stock. Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement superstore, after Home Depot (HD), and the company is having trouble boosting revenues and earnings against its larger competition. LOW shares have been on a roller coaster ride for the last 18 months, although they are up nearly 8% year-to-date. On an operational level, Lowe’s has had difficulty executing online sales strategy and home delivery, and managing inventory control. Both are putting serious drag on the bottom line, and holding down revenue growth.Pushing back is CEO Marvin Ellison, who took over in July of last year. He has marked both online sales and inventory control as key parts of a turnaround effort to improve the company’s sales and revenue growth. Early assessments of Ellison’s success are guardedly optimistic; LOW did beat sales and revenue expectations in its most recent quarterly report, although EPS missed by 8%. As Keith Hughes (Track Record & Ratings), of SunTrust Robinson points out, “The recovery will not be a &quot;quick story&quot;, even though we are positive on the re-set of expectations and maintain that the 10% projected earnings growth this year still tops Home Depot's (HD) expected flat growth.” Hughes sets a $120 price target on LOW, suggesting an upside of 20%.UBS analyst Michael Lasser (Track Record & Ratings) also sets a buy rating on LOW, with an upbeat $115 target and 15% upside. He writes, “The risk-reward ration on the stock is attractive.”On consensus, Lowe’s keeps a ‘Strong Buy’ rating, based on the 14 buys and 4 holds given in the past three months. While the company faces headwinds, it holds a strong position in a valuable niche, and is widely perceived as facing its difficulties effectively. Of the stocks in this article, LOW offers the best upside potential, at 16%, based on the $99 share price and $115 average price target.View LOW Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Like Lowe’s, Walmart gains its defensive-stock status from its business model. The king of brick-and-mortar retailers offers discount customers the ultimate in one-stop shopping, putting everything that consumers could want or need under one roof, from baby diapers to daily groceries to minor car repairs. Really, there’s nothing you can’t get at Walmart and that fact has made it the world’s largest company by revenue and the world’s largest private employer.Walmart’s biggest competition comes from Amazon.com (AMZN), but it is more of a whale and elephant story than a cage match. Each company is dominant in its own domain, and each has faced challenges trying to expand on the other’s territory. Walmart may have found a way to leverage its existing stores for an online advantage – rather than offer home delivery (an area in which Amazon already excels), Walmart offers online purchasers an option to pick up their merchandise at the nearest Walmart location. This is a viable alternative, since according to some estimates everyone in the US lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.As a defensive play, Walmart’s greatest advantage is the pedestrian nature of its business. Everyone needs the products they offer, and in hard times, Walmart’s famously low prices will simply look more attractive. Writing after WMT reported FY20 Q1 earnings, Raymond James’ Budd Bugatch (Track Record & Ratings) said, “Investors should be most encouraged by the U.S. segment, which showed a 5.5 percent year-over-year increase in operating income to $4.1 billion. The business saw strength from a favorable sales mix while e-commerce margins came in better than management's own expectations.” While he believes the company is on firm footing, his price target, at $110, suggests only a modest 1% upside.Guggenheim’s Robert Drbul (Track Record & Ratings) sums up Walmart’s case quite well in his recent research note: “We believe the business remains quite healthy, with solid physical/digital results in recent quarters… We continue to believe WMT’s resources uniquely position it to successfully evolve in an ever-changing retail environment. While trade concerns/tariffs may create quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we believe the management team will astutely navigate any changes.” Drbul maintained a $115, which indicates a 5.5% upside from current levels.On average, WMT shares have a price target of $113, which gives an upside of 4.5% from the share price of $109. The analyst consensus of ‘Moderate Buy’ is based on 8 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months.View WMT Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailYou can learn more about these stocks using TipRanks Stock Comparison tool.

2305,0.9982,"When most investors hunt for dividend stocks, the technology sector is often not on their shopping list. The perception is that most technology firms need and are forced to plow every extra cent back into their businesses in order to fuel growth. As a result, tech stocks are seen as a strictly capital appreciation element for a portfolio.However, this isn't true at all. Tech stocks make for amazing dividend stocks.The reality is, that many firms in the tech sector are cash flow and profit machines. Thanks to surging revenues and high margins, mature tech firms simply mint money at this point. So much, in fact, that many have too much money sitting on their balance sheets. To rid themselves of that excess cash, many tech stocks have started paying some hefty dividends. And they have been growing those dividends by leaps and bounds too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the end, when looking for dividend stocks, the technology sector should be the first stop for portfolios rather than an afterthought. But which tech stocks have what it takes to be considered good dividend stocks as well?  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 Here are five that are worthy of consideration. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.45%No list of dividend stocks in the tech sector can be written without the firm that started the modern trend of payouts from tech. We're talking about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). CSCO started paying a token dividend back in 2011 and hasn't looked back, growing that payout by more than 480%. And it's easy to see why Cisco has become such a dividend stalwart.Sensing a slowdown in networking, router and physical equipment sales, CSCO started to pivot into more software and services. Cloud computing, cybersecurity and other such products have quickly become big-time money makers for the firm. Perhaps, more importantly, these sales come with higher margins, reoccurrence and the ability to add value/upsell networking transactions. &quot;We just built you this massive network for your cloud operations. Would you like us to secure it as well?&quot;Because of this, CSCO has become a cash flow giant. Last quarter alone, the firm managed to see a 16% jump in operating cash flows once adjusting to overseas taxes paid for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, cash on CSCO's balance sheet has swelled to more than $34.6 billion.With sales of software/services continuing to rise, CSCO should be able to keep bringing in the cash for the long haul. Even better is that the growth in data centers and 5G networking is once again boosting equipment sales.At the end of the day, Cisco is one of the best dividend stocks to buy -- tech sector not. Seagate Technology (STX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.75%Like previously mentioned Cisco, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) may seem like a relic from the dot-com days. However, STX has managed to see plenty of new life in recent years. The key is data center demand is making one heck of a dividend stock.For many years after the dot-com bust, STX struggled. The rise of mobile and tablet computing crimped PC sales. At the same time, flash-based solid-state drives (SSD) hit Seagate's platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs) right in the wallet. SSDs are faster, smaller, and more power-efficient. Manufacturers liked these facts and started favoring them in PCS and other devices. As a result, STX stocks stagnated and was looking like a lost cause.That is until cloud computing and data center demand started to take over.It turns out, those building out networks and data centers prefer capacity over speed. That makes HHDs much better suited for this application. Since Seagate dove into SSD production -- like rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- it's been able to reap the full benefits of this expansion. Year to date, STX has managed to produce $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations and $862 million in free cash flows from higher drive demand.  * 6 Growth Stocks That Could Be the Next Big Thing And naturally, Seagate has been rewarding investors with that extra cash. Today, shares yield a tech-sector high 5.75%. Apple (AAPL)Source:  Yuanbin Du Via FlickrDividend Yield: 1.58%225 billion.That's a big number. It also happens to be the amount of cash Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has on its balance sheet. This makes the consumer tech company one of the most cash-rich firms on the planet. That fact alone could make it a big buy. But the fact that Apple has quickly become one of the leading dividend stocks and continues to increase its buyback programs makes it a big buy right now.The key is that Apple has been able to use its vast cadre of devices to sell apps, music, movies and games. This helps Apple produce plenty of cash flows. Meanwhile, its shift into various services and other add-ons for its customers have only enhanced its cash flows further. So, even though AAPL has been handing out plenty of cash to investors, its over cash balance continues to hover over that $200 billion mark. Last year, Apple spent more than $74 billion on buybacks and raised its dividend by roughly 5.5%.With new devices hitting the markets and a focus on building out content for those devices, Apple should have no problem growing that cash balance far into the future. That should make dividend investors happy. And while there are some risks with revenue slowdowns and Chinese trade, that massive cash pile provides such a huge cushion to keep the dividend grow going.With that, Apple is still one of the best dividend stocks around. Equinix (EQIX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.95%One of the biggest trends in tech continues to be the growth of cloud computing and mobile access. Any time you use an app to go shopping or check your bank balance, you're tapping into a data center far away. It turns out that's a very good business to be in. Just ask Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).EQIX is the world's largest owners of these data centers -- with more than 200 under its umbrella. The key is that EQIX doesn't actually own or really operate the centers, it's a real estate investment trust (REITs). That is, it owns the specialized buildings and rents space inside to firms to build their required computing needs. It's essentially an apartment building owner for computers.Given the continued surge in data center demand from e-commerce, cloud computing, and mobile operations, EQIX has been sitting pretty over the last few years. Revenues and funds from operations rose by 14% and 12%, respectively in the first quarter of the year. This continues the REITs string of strong performance. The FFO growth is of particular interest as this cash flow directly translates into how much money a REIT can hand back as dividends to its shareholders.On that front, EQIX has been a champion as well. The data center giant has paid plenty of special stock dividends to its shareholders and has managed to grow its cash payout by 45% since 2014.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 With continued demand for data centers assured, EQIX is the best dividend stock to play tech's backbone. Shares currently yield 1.95%. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (TDIV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.97%Considering that this list didn't even touch such amazing tech dividend stocks like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or even Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), one approach could be to think broad. There are plenty of tech ETFs on the market, but only the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (NYSEArca:TDIV) tackles the sector with a dividend approach.The $1 billion fund tracks an index that screens for tech stocks that have paid a regular or common dividend within the past 12 months and haven't cut the payout either. This provides exposure to all the top names in tech that pay dividends -- currently at 83 different stocks. This includes all the names on this list as well. That focus also throws off a surprising amount of income as well. Today, TDIV has an SEC 30-day yield of nearly 3%. That's' better than the S&P 500 and current yields on Treasury bonds.And as a total return component, TDIV has been top notch. Since its inception in 2012, the ETF has roughly doubled in share price and managed to produce an average annual return of around 12%. That's around the same as the S&P 500. The key is that TDIV has been less volatile than the broader index. Less volatile than all the tech stocks in the broader index as well. The secret is in the power of the dividends.All in all, for investors looking to score some hefty dividends from tech and take advantage of the sector's growth, TDIV could be the best way to capture those benefits.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

2361,0.9987,"Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) seemingly can do no wrong in investors' eyes. The ROKU stock price has risen 232% so far this year. Among stocks with a market capitalization above $1 billion, only one -- Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) -- has done better.Source: Roku Much of the gains seem to have come from sentiment, rather than performance. Roku's first-quarter earnings were impressive, but the company only raised full-year revenue guidance by a couple of million dollars. The increase in the ROKU stock price from pre-earnings levels has added some $4 billion in market value.From here, it looks like too much -- though, admittedly, I've said that before. Back in September, I argued investors should take profits at $70. From a short-term standpoint, that was brilliant advice: ROKU shares would drop 60% in a little over three months. Of course, the stock now is almost 50% above those levels after the torrid gains of late.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be sure, I don't think Roku is headed back to $35 or anything close. This remains a wonderful business. I've compared the company to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in terms of its potential to expand well beyond its initial model (book-selling for Amazon, player revenues for Roku). I'm more skeptical than most that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will dislodge Roku from its leadership in streaming. And I see real growth ahead for Roku.But that's kind of the point: As highly as I think of Roku as a business, I still question ROKU as a stock. And I don't believe, at these prices, it will take much for the market to come around to that viewpoint. ROKU Valuation and Player RevenueRoku isn't yet profitable -- though it is guiding for $10-$20 million in Adjusted EBITDA this year -- so valuation comes down, at the moment, to revenue. And, on that front, even at $100+ ROKU stock doesn't look ridiculously expensive.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession After all, ROKU is valued at just over 11 times its revenue. That's a big number, obviously, but not huge in context. Shares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), another consumer-focused platform play, are valued at over 20x sales. (SHOP has some valuation concerns, too, admittedly.) Square (NYSE:SQ) is at about 12x its 2019 guidance for adjusted revenue (which backs out transaction costs). Even Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), a more mature company, is valued at over 10x sales (including debt).This is not to say that ROKU is, thus, cheap. But 11x revenue, on its face, isn't obviously illogical. Given that revenue rose 51% in first quarter and is expected to grow 40%+ for the full year, a big multiple makes some sense. Whether &quot;big&quot; means 7x or 11x or 15x likely depends on the type of investor making the case.But there's a catch here. About one-third of this year's revenue, per Roku management, is coming from the sale of players. And that revenue is not worth 11x -- or anything close. Roku likely loses money on player sales: gross margin was 9.8% in Q1 and just 2.4% the quarter before. Combined, the company earned $10 million in gross profit in those two quarters -- and spent $106.7 million just on research and development, much of that spend taking place in the hardware business.It's the platform revenue investors want to buy -- and that revenue this year will only be about $700 million by management estimates. That figure suggests that Roku is trading for a &quot;true&quot; revenue multiple of about 16x. That certainly gets closer to obviously illogical. Is Roku's Business Good Enough?In other words, the only remotely comparable stock that is valued more dearly than Roku is probably Shopify. SHOP has gone on a historic run -- it's gained 120% year-to-date -- and benefits from a likely larger market opportunity. Logically, Roku should trade at a discount to SHOP, but the current gap isn't that big.Is Roku as a company that good, where it's dearly valued even in the rarefied air of fast-growing platform and/or software plays? Perhaps. It's benefiting from the disruption of video content consumption -- and driving some of that disruption itself. The Roku Channel has a clear opportunity. Advertisers continue to flock to its platform. Users are growing, as are hours streamed: the latter figure rose nearly 80% year over year in Q1.All that said, there are some question marks here. Roku still gets immaterial revenue from Netflix and YouTube, which remain the favorite apps among Roku users. The Roku Channel is intriguing -- but it doesn't take a long look at stocks like CBS (NYSE:CBS) or AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) to see what investors think about ad-supported video at the moment.What's intriguing about Roku is the reason I compared it to Amazon: we don't really know where Roku is going to go, or what it will look like a few years from now. With 29 million accounts, Roku has a base for new initiatives in video or even music streaming. It still has room to go international. Roku can find new ways to add value.But there are still questions about what the business is right now. One-third of revenue is unprofitable. A decent chunk of the remainder comes from the Roku Channel, which potentially puts Roku at odds with some of the offerings on its platforms (think so-called vMPVDs like YouTube TV or DIRECTV NOW from AT&T (NYSE:T)). This isn't a perfect story yet. But the ROKU stock price suggests that it is. A ROKU Pullback?And so there appear to be two near-term risks to the ROKU stock price. The first is that investors question whether paying 15x+ revenue for any stock is wise. We may not see a repeat of the December sell-off that led ROKU shares to plunge, but a correction -- particularly in high-growth names -- wouldn't be a surprise.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 The second is that investors keep paying up for quality, but decide Roku doesn't quite belong in the upper tier of growth stocks. That's my sense at the moment, and the key reason for caution above $100. Almost everything has to go right for Roku to keep moving higher -- both in terms of its performance and in overall investor sentiment.That seems like too much to ask in this market -- and maybe too much to ask of this business.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

I am guilty of it too, but unlike the naysayers, I set my personal feelings aside and I trade it from the long side. Yes, I said it. I trade AAPL stock, I don't own it. There is nothing wrong with doing that, because the investment methods depend on individual time frames and investor goals.Source: Shutterstock Recently, the opinions on mega-cap stocks have become very bifurcated. There is a political move to break them up. Politicians are using companies like Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to win votes.Regardless of their intentions, the headlines from the legislators caused a crash in the largest technology companies on the planet. Usually AAPL stock is not included, but this time it was also singled out for its app store fairness of competition.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis was the straw that broke the AAPL's back. It was already burdened with the threats from its China businesses. Recently Goldman Sachs scared investors by citing their estimate that Apple can take a 29% hit to its earnings from the economic war with China. How Does AAPL Stock Look Going ForwardTo me this was ridiculous and disproportionate to Apple's total sales in China. Maybe it was blissful ignorance on my part, but I bought the dip by selling puts at the lows and also bought calls. Since then, the stock rallied 13%, so I am basically long AAPL stock for free going into its next earnings report.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession The opportunity is over? No. Apple still has more upside and maybe even the chance to set new all-time highs. I know this statement will draw chuckles, but only time will tell.First the fundamental foundation to support my thesis.Apple is cheap, as it sells at a 16x trailing price-to-earnings ratio. This is well below that of GOOGL or FB stock, so there is very little froth. Moreover, the stock just fell into support, and that also becomes more solid footing for the next few weeks. These two serve as a the strong base that the bulls need to attack the neckline.Let's look at the levels that matter for this write up. The fall of 2018 was devastating to AAPL, but the 2019 bounce was phenomenal. What's interesting is that the correction we just had ended at exactly the .618 Fibonacci level. Machines know exactly where to buy stocks at the expense of the retail investors who panic on tough days.  Click to Enlarge If the Apple bulls can continue the bounce to recover the whole thing and reach the ledge from which they fell in May, they will have the chance to launch a massive move to take out the highs.So the opportunity here is two fold. The first is that there still is time to ride this rebound. The second is more exciting, because when the price exceeds $215 per share, the rally will kick into overdrive. This would constitute a breach of a neckline to launch a couple of bullish patterns. The easiest to see is a cup-and-handle-ish pattern where with $30 to $50 potential rally from the neckline. I could also argue that the price action is unfolding in an abc-like pattern where the third leg is only one third done.Either way I look at it, if the bulls on Wall Street retain the reins for the next few weeks, Apple stock has a legitimate shot at setting new highs. If not, at least drop a few jaws along the way. If the politicians spoil this party then I have to consider that below $170, AAPL stock would risk retesting the 2019 lows.Before you classify me as a perma-bull for the Apple stock, I have been on record with my displeasure with Tim Cook's leadership. He inherited a gem and he is ruining it. Experts often point to the market cap that he has created for investors but I argue that the whole market is up and at or near all-time highs. Apple is nowhere near its high mark. Furthermore, he borrowed over $100 billion to buy back stock to achieve this financial engineering marvel.Sure, great things happened under Tim Cook's rule, but I bet they would have happened even without a replacement leader. AAPL stock had enough momentum going after Steve Jobs that it would have continued its trajectory without its current leader.I hear him often defend his record on innovation by pointing out the new things he's accomplished. If he needs to point them out, they are probably not innovations.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2364,0.9911,"Before Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) reached a settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over their long-simmering royalty dispute in mid-April, owners of QCOM stock would likely have been delighted if it hit $70. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, once the news got out that Qualcomm would get at least $4.5 billion from Apple as part of its settlement, QCOM stock had nowhere to go but up, jumping 59% over 12 days of trading, to a 52-week high of $90.34. It was at that point that Qualcomm shareholders started to dream about joining the triple-digit club.And then U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled May 22 that Qualcomm violated antitrust laws by extracting higher patent license fees from smartphone makers. That sent its stock 15% lower over the next five days of trading.Which begs the question: Is QCOM a $60 stock or an $80 stock? It's a $60 StockThe argument that Qualcomm is a $60 stock begins with a look back at its history.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Since going public in December 1991, Qualcomm has traded above $80 for a reasonable amount of time on just three occasions: December 1999, May 2014 and April 2019. That's three times in 25 years. In contrast, QCOM stock traded below $60 for 11.5 years between May 2000 and January 2012. Between January 2012 and today, it's spent most of the time trading down to $50 and up to $70, making $60 a common resting place. While most analysts are positive about Qualcomm's future, the ruling against the company hurts its future earnings from patent fees and royalties.&quot;This is a gut punch to Qualcomm and could have a major ripple impact across the smartphone industry,&quot; said Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities on May 22. &quot;It could not come at a worse time for Qualcomm going into 5G and its pricing power on chips.&quot;If the ruling stands on appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Qualcomm would be required to use component-level licensing, which would reduce the amount it could make off smartphone-makers like Apple. As a result, while the judge's decision does little to affect Qualcomm in the near-term, the stock's long-term attractiveness isn't nearly as bright.  It's an $80 StockAs I said in the previous section, analysts are primarily supportive of QCOM stock. Currently,  26 analysts have a rating on Qualcomm with 16 calling it a &quot;buy&quot; and 10 a &quot;hold&quot;. As for earnings and price targets, the average analyst has a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share estimate of $5.26; as for its 12-month price target, the high estimate is $115, the low is $65, and the average is $89, an upside of 27% as of June 7Based on $5.26 in 2020 earnings, its stock is trading around 13 times those earnings. Over the past five years, Qualcomm's P/E has averaged 19 -- not once has it traded below 15 times earnings over the past decade. Despite this little setback in the courts, QCOM stock is looking very inexpensive.That's especially true when you consider that QCOM stock is currently yielding 3.5%, generating more than $3 billion in free cash flow and debt is a reasonable 18% of its market cap.   The Verdict on QCOM StockIf you take Qualcomm's trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.1 billion and enterprise value of $91.8 billion, you get a free cash flow yield of 3.3%. By comparison, Apple's current free cash flow yield is 6.5%, with a dividend yield of 1.6%.For income investors, settling for Apple and half the yield might be too hard to swallow.  * 10 High-Tech Gifts for Father's Day 2019 Also, Qualcomm supplies 50% of the global smartphone market. An investment in QCOM means you've got a good shot of winning no matter who the dominant smartphone player is. However, with Apple, you've got to hope that it retains its lead to keep winning.For this reason, I believe that QCOM is an $80 stock despite faltering on several occasions over the past five years.

2365,0.9552,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was dealt a huge blow on May 21, when a U.S. District Court Judge sided with the Federal Trade Commission and ruled the company had violated antitrust laws. QCOM stock tanked as investors absorbed the prospect of Qualcomm seeing its patent royalties reduced to pennies just as business was ramping up in the race to 5G smartphones. However, since May 28 when QCOM filed a motion to stay the ruling while it appeals, the stock has been steadily gaining ground.Source: Shutterstock That trend has come to an end. Yesterday, both LG Electronics and the FTC filed motions in federal court, opposing QCOM's request for business as usual while it prepares an appeal. As a result, QCOM stock is down 1.5% at the time of this writing. Qualcomm Stock Hit By Latest FTC FilingThe prospect of being forced to adopt FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms for its smartphone modem-related technology patents would be a huge blow to Qualcomm's revenue -- and to Qualcomm stock. But that was the outcome of the FTC's antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The Judge ruled that Qualcomm's business model of collecting licensing fees from all smartphone manufacturers -- regardless of whose cellular modem is in their product -- was anticompetitive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year The ruling that QCOM would have to license the technology under a FRAND model meant the fees it collects from manufacturers would be slashed. In the company's recent battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the iPhone maker was fighting against paying a licensing fee of $7.50 per phone (on top of the $30 modem), instead of the $1.50 it had been holding out for. Under FRAND, the terms would likely be even lower than what Apple was pushing for. Qualcomm stock dropped like a rock after that ruling on May 21.On May 28, Qualcomm filed a motion asking the judge to stay the ruling, while it files an appeal. That news kicked off two weeks of slow but steady gains for Qualcomm stock because if granted, the stay meant business as usual until the formal appeal is filed and heard. And that could take several years.Yesterday, both the FTC and LG filed motions in federal court aimed at blocking Qualcomm's request for a stay. LG noted in its filing that it is currently in negotiations with QCOM to renew a modem license that expires on June 30, adding urgency to the issue. The company says QCOM is pushing hard to ink a deal under the current monopolistic terms, aiming to lock LG into an expensive contract. QCOM stock has been down in pre-market trading, with investors worried about the prospect that this countermove could result in Qualcomm's stay being denied -- and the company's licensing revenue being decimated by the immediate adoption of FRAND terms. QCOM Stock's Short-Lived ResurgenceWhen Qualcomm won its years-long legal battle with Apple in April, QCOM stock was on fire. Apple would surrender the licensing fees it had been withholding during the court case. Qualcomm's revenue would be boosted by the licensing fee per iPhone Apple would now be paying under the new agreement. The icing on the cake? After dumping Qualcomm modems in favor of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Apple would go back to QCOM, and even in this era of stalling iPhone sales, that means another 40 million or more units per month, at $30 or so a pop.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money As a result of that ruling, QCOM stock shot up 23% on the first day, eventually peaking at $89.29 in early May, a five-year high for QCOM.Unfortunately for anyone who bought Qualcomm stock immediately after that win, the company's challenges extend far beyond just Apple. The reaction of QCOM stock to the latest motion from the FTC shows just how much is riding on the final outcome of its antitrust case, and how important even the lead-up to the appeal will be for Qualcomm. The result of the latest FTC motion could mean the difference between several more years of current-level licensing revenue for Qualcomm during the appeal process, or an immediate imposition of FRAND terms.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

For the quarter ending June 2018, Apple spent $20.8 billion and in the next quarter, the company spent $18.7 billion. In these two quarters, close to 5% of the outstanding shares were expunged.However, in the quarter ending December 2018, there was a correction of 32%. Apple suddenly applied the brakes on buybacks in the December ending quarter despite a massive decline in price. The buybacks in this quarter were $8.79 billion, less than half of the previous two quarters.In the quarter ending March 2019, the price jumped from $157 to $191. Since then, Apple stock price peaked at $211 and subsequently fell to $175 on trade worries. There was little change in the expectations or core fundamentals of the company, yet we saw a significant jump and decline in Apple stock. Investors should consider the impact of buybacks on short-term price movement to find an ideal entry point. Difficult to JustifyIn the second and third quarter of calendar year 2018, Apple bought back $41 billion of outstanding stock when the price shot up from $166 to $227. On the other hand, the buybacks were only $8.79 billion in the last quarter of the calendar year 2018, when the price cratered from $227 to less than $150. A similar trend was seen in the last quarter.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Apple bought $23 billion of stock in the last quarter, its highest quarterly buyback, which helped improve the stock momentum. The stock was at $191 by end of March 2019. Apple stock price is sometimes used as its own reason to justify the fundamentals of the company instead of the other way around. The bullish sentiment towards the stock increased massively when the stock price shot beyond $200 while it was at the lowest when Apple's price dropped below $150. AAPL Stock Moving Beyond Trade WorriesIn the past few weeks, Apple stock dipped to less than $175. If the trade war between the U.S. and China escalates further, Apple would face significant headwinds. Goldman Sachs has forecasted that Apple could show a 29% decline in EPS if China bans Apple products. Recently, the U.S. administration has announced that tariffs on further $300 billion of imports from China could soon be announced. This would include almost all the products imported from China into the U.S., including all the Apple products. Despite this threat, Apple stock has surged in the last few days to over $185. Again, one of the main reasons could be a higher buyback pace. Eventually, it is in the management's hand on how fast they would like to pursue stock buybacks. But there can be huge short-term fluctuations in the stock price depending on this pace which might not be reflected by the fundamentals. Future Buyback StoryIn the latest earnings call, Apple's management reiterated the claim that they are trying to reach a cash-neutral position. Apple has continued to show a big decline in the operating margin. In the recent quarter, Apple reported an operating margin of 23.12%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 26%. Hence, Apple has shown an operating margin decline of 288 basis points in the recent quarter. Trade worries continue to be a big challenge for the company.From a fundamental point of view, few things have changed since the stock ducked below $145 in the last quarter of 2018. While there are a number of metrics which investors should watch to gauge the future momentum of Apple stock, the biggest factor will be the pace of buybacks.Source: CNBC How to Play This?Apple had allowed the stock to decline in the holiday quarter without increasing the allotment towards buybacks. On the other hand, Apple continued to make significant buybacks in the last quarter, even when the stock price was close to $190. This shows that investors cannot be guaranteed a solid floor for the stock price. If management plans to go easy on the buybacks in a particular quarter and the overall sentiment is also bearish, investors should buckle up for a significant decline in Apple stock. However, if the overall sentiment is bullish and the management accelerates buybacks, we can see expensive valuation levels for the stock.The above chart shows that Apple bought back stock aggressively from April to September 2018, when the EV to FCF ratio was over 16. However, for the majority of the time in the last quarter of the calendar year 2018, the stock was below 16 times EV to FCF ratio and yet the buyback pace was very low. A big spike in buybacks in the last quarter helped in showing a bullish momentum for Apple stock.Hence, it would be ideal to wait for a quarter when Apple is reducing the pace of its buybacks. Targeting an entry point of 10-12 times EV to FCF is also better than an entry at over 18 times EV to FCF. Investors should follow the announcements on the future direction of buybacks to get an ideal entry point for the stock.  Investor TakeawayApple's price movement is highly dependent on the pace of stock buybacks. The aggressive pace of buybacks helped the stock momentum in the second and third quarters of 2018, and a similar trend could be seen in the last quarter. At the same time, lower buybacks in the holiday quarter of 2018 was one of the reasons behind a 32% correction in that quarter. Apple made the highest quarterly buyback in the last quarter which helped in improving the bullish momentum for Apple stock.Besides trade tensions, Apple stock is significantly dependent on the pace of buybacks in the near term. Investors should closely follow future buyback announcement to find an ideal entry point in Apple stock.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2368,0.9628,"Investors sold off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock on June 3 when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an antitrust probe of FB. This has become part of a government probe on big tech in general. It also is the latest in a series of investigations of Facebook's business practices. Facebook stock subsequently recovered all the ground it lost in the wake of the announcement..Source: Shutterstock FB's quick recovery shows that Wall Street has begun to see these investigations for what they are--buying opportunities. History has shown that  government probes rarely lead to breakups of companies, and that investors who buy the stocks of the companies being investigated when the inquiries are announced usually make meaningful profits.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession  The Chance to Buy FB Came and Went QuicklyInvestors had to act quickly to benefit from the decline of Facebook stock. FB lost 7.5% of its value the day the government announced the inquiry. However, as mentioned earlier,  FB stock has already recovered all of that lost value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company has faced numerous accusations from both U.S. and European regulatory authorities over the last couple of years. Perhaps such charges no longer phase  investors too much. But I believe that  the quick recovery of FB stock indicates that investors see little cause to worry about FB at this point.Both the case itself and the history of antitrust actions indicate that investors have made the right call.Moreover, the justification for breaking up other giant tech companies is stronger than the case for dividing  FB. Nobody has to share anything on Facebook. Moreover, unlike Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FB does not derive significant revenues directly from tens of millions of  consumers. That may explain why Facebook stock climbed back to its previous level so quickly. Antitrust Probes Will Only Help FBHere is the dirty secret about antitrust investigation: investors almost always win these battles, and the companies supposedly victimized by antitrust probes fare nearly as well.For one, such investigations rarely lead to the breakup of monopolies. Just look at the history of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The antitrust probe regarding the monopoly power of Windows ultimately led to only mild sanctions. That monopoly power no longer exists, but it was the market (and not the government) that made the dominance of Windows irrelevant. Also, traders should note that MSFT has now achieved record valuations after reducing its dependence on its operating system.Even on the rare occasions that the government splits companies, investors also fare well. A high-profile breakup occurred in 1911, when the government ordered the break up of Standard Oil into 34 different parts. Rather than disappearing, the various parts of Standard Oil exist more than 100 years later as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and BP (NYSE:BP).The 1982 breakup of AT&T was followed by  a boom by the telecom industry for the remainder of the 20th century. The break up produced AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), which have all done pretty well over the decades.So history shows  that a breakup of FB could become a gold mine for investors. The probe could lead to some embarrassment for the company, or even fines. However, once Facebook settles its differences with regulators, FB will resume its positive, long-term growth trajectory. Final Thoughts on FacebookSome investors have already benefited from the FTC's antitrust probe of FB. Facebook stock initially fell. but within a week, it has already recovered.  Apparently investors realize that  government probes create buying opportunities.In the future, instead of worrying about the negative impact of investigations on FB, investors should react to the news of such probes by buying FB stock as quickly as possible.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Roll CallIn late trading on the Dow Jones today, 18 of the 30 members were in the green, though just a handful were higher by 1% or more. Industrial component Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the largest maker of construction equipment, was the Dow's best performer on a percentage basis today.

The stock is trying to work its way out of a bear market (still 19.90% below its 52-week high) and if it can gain another 4.4% to reclaim its 200-day moving average, there could be something to see here.Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added 1.16% after iPhone supplier Foxconn said Tuesday that is the capability to shift iPhone assembly out of China if needed and that it has capacity in other locations to meet U.S. demand for the popular smartphone. About a quarter of Foxconn's production capacity is found outside of China.Apple is now on a six-day winning streak. CEO Tim Cook said last week he does not expect China to overtly target his company as a result of the trade war and analysts seem to think tariff talk as it pertain to Apple is mostly noise.&quot;The fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable with shares baking in a much more draconian/worst-case scenario,&quot; said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent note.As was noted here yesterday, the Dow's financial services components have been solid recently. While the group did not set the world on fire today, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trader higher on the likelihood of higher dividends from the sector following completion of the Federal Reserve's stress tests.&quot;Large bank stocks could go still higher, boosted by double-digit dividend increases expected to be authorized under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, according to analysts at JPMorgan,&quot; reports Lawrence Strauss for Barron's. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today: Banks And Burgers?With dividends poised to rise, revenue streams that rely heavily on the U.S. and surprisingly low volatility, bank stocks, including those in the Dow, are sensible ideas for investors to consider over the near-term.Add burgers into that conversation as Dow component McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continues trading higher. On Tuesday, UBS reiterated a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on the stock, but did boost its price target to $203 from $185. Shares of McDonald's are up nearly 14% this year, so it is not clear why UBS is not rating the stock a &quot;buy&quot; while raising its price target, but more upside appears imminent for the fast-food giant.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2419,-0.9882,"Another roller coaster week is upon us, as many analysts highlight that the U.S.-China trade war has caused the global economy to become unstable and has had a negative impact on investor sentiment. Wall Street is now discussing whether the trade wars may end up becoming tech wars. Recent worries about tariffs on Mexican goods have also added to the increased volatility in the markets. Finally, the month of June has witnessed various headlines that the U.S. Justice Department may be going after several big tech names for antitrust issues.Markets suffer during times of uncertainty and in the coming months, I expect the price of many tech stocks to be a battleground between investors and traders. Stocks tend to behave differently in a falling market than they do in a rising one. The down moves can be rather fast in a declining market, and a momentum stock may become a falling knife. I personally do not like catching falling knives.Therefore, today, I'd like to discuss five tech stocks to avoid in the second half of June and possibly until they report earnings later in the summer. These stocks are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough the broader markets and tech stocks have gone up in the past few trading sessions, I'd urge investors to not get too optimistic with these tech names just yet. In other words, most tech stocks had been way oversold, so a relief rally was inevitable. For retail investors, discipline would be rather crucial at this point.Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in these tech stocks. If they already own shares, they may either consider taking some money off the table during this market bounce or hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession With all of that in mind, let's dive a little deeper into each of these stocks. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Shutterstock Notable Risks: Potential decline in ad revenues, antitrust issues, government regulation and broader tech market weaknessExpected Price Range: $940-$1,090Google parent Alphabet is one of the largest and most widely followed companies in the market. Many investors are wondering whether the recent decline of Alphabet stock has now created a good entry point.Google's dominant core business is &quot;search,&quot; where it has 90% market share globally. In recent years, it has also been incubating other &quot;moonshot&quot; ventures, such as Weymo, the self-driving car business or CapitalG, the late-stage venture capital arm, that could eventually become the next Google.Income from digital advertising, which mostly consists of its search and YouTube ecosystem, contributes to over 80% of revenues. Investors are especially concerned that the group's core advertising business is likely to be at a plateau. They are now watching Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) increased presence in the market closely.In 2018, Google's ad business grew 20% and was outpaced by both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at 30% and Amazon at 95%. In other words, GOOGL is likely to face more competition in the future from them. Therefore Google's advertising revenue may take a hit, especially if the U.S. economy cools down in the months ahead.Many analysts are also concerned about YouTube, once a crown jewel and currently a big headache. During the earnings call of April 29, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat announced various changes to YouTube so that the company could better curb the spread of toxic content, such as fake news and conspiracy theories. The result of the problems and the efforts to tame the issues has been loss of advertising revenue on YouTube.Therefore, long-term investors are likely to wait for the next earnings report in late July to see how revenue has fared amid the competition from Facebook and Amazon. In other words, if Google investors do not like the earnings results then, there might be further price pressure and reaction to the downside.Especially, over the past two years, like several other big tech names in the social media space, Google stock has been trying to address conflicting demands for privacy and security as it faces calls by global governments to regulate its services. There seems to be bipartisan support for cracking down on big tech and many in the U.S. would like to see it it broken up.Then the month of June started with the headlines that the Justice Department is preparing an antitrust investigation of Google. Scholars and analysts have long debated the potential effects of antitrust policy on consumer welfare. Yet, for shareholders in a company, it simply means uncertainty.At this point, it is hard to know what the outcome of this investigation would be on the GOOGL stock price. However, when a company like Alphabet faces a probe by the U.S. government, it is fair to say that investors would sell the stock first and ask questions later.Today, I'm not entirely convinced that GOOGL shares have found a bottom yet. They will continue to be volatile on a daily and weekly basis. In the coming weeks, if we have more headlines that suggest a long governmental probe into anti-competitive practices by the company, Alphabet stock is likely to decline to the triple digits, possibly towards the low-$900 level. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock Notable Risks: Trade wars, currency fluctuations and broader tech market weaknessPossible Price Range: $165-$195With a market cap of $874 billion, AAPL stock has the second-highest weighting in the S&P 500, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And China is Apple's second-most important market.Apple stock initially went up at the start of May following a positive Q2 earnings report released on April 30. However, news about the trade war with China followed by complaints about Apple's App Store pricing pressured the AAPL stock price down.Then last week, the stock staged back an impressive rally along with the rest of the market. So is the worst for Apple behind it?It'd be fair to say that Apple stock has now become a proxy for the trade wars between the U.S. and China. Almost 20% of Apple's revenues come from China. In 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, sales of iPhones in China have declined. And there's a good possibility that China's economy will slow some more.Furthermore, AAPL relies on Chinese suppliers and its mobile devices are assembled in China. Thus, Apple would have to react to tariffs either by increasing prices in the U.S. or absorbing the cost of the tariffs. The latter action would definitely have a major negative impact on the price of Apple stock.It is no wonder that, since early 2018, but especially over the past few weeks, the trade dispute has negatively affected the price of Apple stock. The further the signing of the trade deal gets pushed out, the greater the adverse effect on Apple's future earnings and AAPL stock could be.If AAPL's sales, margins, and revenue all decline in China amid increased competition from local companies, including Huawei, and currency headwinds, then the multiple of Apple stock will drop.  * 7 Top-Rated Vanguard ETFs to Buy in 2019 Year-to-date, AAPL shares are up 20%. Not all investors are comfortable with the increased volatility levels in the stock. If you are a shareholder who has been able to ride the impressive rally since early January, then you may want to take some of your profits in Apple stock. Baidu (BIDU)Source: Shutterstock Notable Risks: Valuation, questions about growth, trade wars and broader tech market weaknessPossible Price Range: $85-$125Could this be the month to become a contrarian investor and establish or build on existing positions in China's leading companies? Many investors would specifically be asking about the stock price of Baidu, the Chinese-based search engine. I'd say, no, it is not an opportunistic time to buy into BIDU shares … yet.During the past year, the BIDU stock price is down 58%. On July 13, 2018, the shares saw a high of $274. Now, Baidu stock is hovering around $110. Clearly, the bears have taken control of the tape.What is the main reason for the deterioration of Baidu's market cap? Investors fear that the group's growth narrative does not hold any more.BIDU has two sources of revenue:  * Internet advertising business (which is at the core); and  * Income from majority ownership in iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ)The tech market in China has grown exponentially in the last decade. And Baidu stock has been able to ride that wave. Baidu has over 70% of the Chinese online search marketshare. Until about a year ago, this leadership has meant growing advertising revenues and solid margins.However, that is not the case anymore. Competitors like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have been pressuring its business model and ad revenues. Many Chinese consumers are using apps that bypass browsers and thus Baidu's search engine. In other words, BIDU stock's desktop search business is being disrupted or even displaced.Wall Street is not sure if management knows how to go after the challenge to Baidu's core business. The company has increased spending to attract more advertisers, which in turn has affected margins. In other words, the company spends a lot of cash to make some money.Furthermore, as the Chinese economy slows down, all these companies chase the same advertisers, who have been scaling down ad budgets.The second factor adversely affecting Baidu's top-line growth comes from its ownership of iQiyi, the so-called Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of China. Baidu still owns roughly two-thirds of iQiyi, so IQ's results and its growth are reflected in Baidu's consolidated numbers. And iQiyi stock is not making any money at this point, either.Management at iQiyi has underlined that as the company further invests in technology and builds content, the cost of revenue would be high, i.e., the company will not be profitable any time soon.And when you add the uncertainty around trade wars, it may just not be fashionable to buy BIDU shares in 2019. Overall, the bull thesis supporting BIDU stock is falling apart. It would be important to analyze the next earnings report expected in August to see if Baidu stock has a better investment proposition for long-term investors. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Shutterstock Notable Risks: Fundamentals, semiconductor weakness, trade wars and broader tech market weaknessPossible Price Range: $100-$160On May 16, Nvidia reported that its net income had fallen to $394 million in its fiscal first quarter from $1.24 billion during the same period a year earlier. Overall, NVDA stock did not perform well in the wake of the result, which also included mostly in-line guidance.The Nvidia stock price has decreased from the mid-$160s to the mid-$130s. It is currently hovering around the $145 level.Previously a darling among investors, especially in 2017 and most of 2018, it has recently fallen out of grace. Nvidia stock gets a lot of attention, compared with other chip stocks. Many investors regard Nvidia as the premiere graphics-chip stock.Nvidia sells two main products: graphics processing units (GPU) and Tegra processors. Nvidia's graphic processing units are used in PCs and data centers. Tegra is a system-on-a-chip (SoC) suite developed by Nvidia for mobile devices. But its Tegra Processors segment only accounts for about 10% of its total revenues.Over the past year, the price of Nvidia stock is down 45%. Clearly, investors are taking another look at the company's fundamental growth outlook, which is mostly based on its GPUs for gaming and artificial-intelligence servers.Wall Street is also debating whether the semiconductor industry, which is highly competitive and cyclical, has entered a prolonged downturn.The chip sector is being hurt by rising inventories and trade-war concerns. In its quarterly report, Nvidia said that the sector's inventory levels stood at $1.43 billion, up from $797 million a year earlier.  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year Despite the recent slide of NVDA stock, it might still be too early to get back into it, given its short-term risks, which make it a highly volatile investment. In other words, I recommend that investors wait for several weeks before buying NVDA stock. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock Notable Risks: Fundamentals, profit-taking, trade wars and broader tech market weaknessPossible Price Range: $175-$225Tesla stock went up over 10% on May 2 and 3 as new regulatory filings showed that the company would be raising extra cash in U.S. markets through a combination of new shares and convertible debt.But since then, TSLA shares have been in a free fall. During May, many analysts have issued research notes and price target updates on Tesla stock. On June 3, the share price hit a 52-week low of $176.99.Last week, following the broad market rally, Tesla shares went back over $200. Now investors are wondering whether TSLA stock can stay above this psychologically important level. I am of the camp that the price is likely to go below $200 again in the near future.My basic fundamental view is that we do not know what exactly is going on at Tesla and that the company is facing a crisis. In general, a company's problems may come from different angles, such as:  * Working capital/liquidity  * Financial  * Profitability  * Operational  * Industry Outlook  * Corporate Governance  * EmployeesInvestors usually can get a sense of any current and future problems by looking at operational and market performance as well as at basic financial metrics and cash flow.In Tesla's case, we may have a combination of signs of difficulty.The past year has seen the demand for electric-vehicles (EV) decline in the U.S. And Tesla's Model 3 sales have not been at the levels expected.As we discuss Tesla's problems, we have to mention that the auto sector is susceptible to the trade-war risk. As the demand in the U.S. declines, Tesla needs to achieve increased sales numbers from overseas, namely China, the largest electric-vehicle market in the world.All these problems are now contributing to the constant talks of liquidity issues at Tesla. Could this be the beginning of the end for TSLA stock?If the group is indeed in trouble, a successful turnaround would possibly require a focus on cash and cash returns. Not focusing clearly on cash may send a company into a spiral that may become rather difficult to recover from.Although many companies experience some financial difficulty at some point in their history, the first potential step to lead a company out of a crisis would be to acknowledge that there is a severe problem.There might be a plethora of reasons why management does not realize the situation may be worsening. They may be underestimating the severity of the problem, or they may be looking at poor data. Or the focus may be so short-term that they neglect the long-term health of the company.At this point, TSLA stock has had several months of poor performance, both in terms of metrics and the stock price. Stakeholders are hoping that the senior team at Tesla is currently asking the right questions and having honest discussions about the potential severity of issues.Investors would like Tesla management to offer their employees, shareholders and Wall Street a concise and compelling change story, without too many fancy metrics and big words. When TSLA clarifies the reasons to be positive about the company again, the decline in the stock price will likely come to a halt.Therefore, before committing any capital into the shares, I'd like to see the next earnings statement, expected in late July. By then, we might even have an earnings warning statement, which would send the stock even further south.At this point, Tesla bears have the upper hand and I'd consider investing in TSLA stock as a speculative bet.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2428,0.9607,"What a difference six months can make. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock is down 30% in the past couple of years. But therein lies an opportunity to ride the upswing momentum now going into the summer.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrYes, JD stock has been sliding for a while, but lately the tide has been changing. Year-to-date, it's up 30%, which is double the performance of the S&P 500. Clearly, the bulls are setting a tradeable bottom. In early March, and after a strong earnings report, I wrote about the bullish opportunity in JD. The trade worked well for a while, then the geopolitical rhetoric soured all equities in a big way.We went from almost having an imminent trade deal between China and the U.S. back to being at square one. Stocks like JD are sensitive to the political rhetoric because, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it sits in the line of fire.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut there is good news to surmise from the price action. First is that the JD stock bulls are not dead. They succeeded in setting higher highs. Sure they failed after hitting prior two accident scenes at $30 and $32 per share but that is part of normal price action.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Once a stock revisits a ledge from which it fell hard, it finds sellers. So it's natural it works through those orders before it continues higher. But it is important that the bulls hold support levels so they don't have to reestablish their footing.In this case, JD.com stock held the $25.50 zone. This was important because it served as the neckline for the late February breakout. It is normal for a stock to revisit the neckline from which it last broke out to test its strength. Bulls now know that they can rely on it as solid footing.It is also important to note that this happened without any China deal hopium and in spite of the bad news. This lowers the JD risk that if the Trump / Xi meeting fails in a few weeks. It is still vulnerable because this is not a cheap stock.To that point, JD sells at an price-to-earnings ratio of 80. This is almost three times more expensive than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). This is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) P/E territory, but without the substance that AMZN brings. So JD stock has a lot of potential froth to shed should Wall Street have another tizzy. How to Approach JD StockThis is not the same as saying the stock is too expensive nor is it a judgement of its potential. I am merely pointing out the downside risk if the outside factors cause another selling equity wave. It would whirlwind JD into another test of support. If it fails this time, it could target $22 per share. I am in no way calling for this scenario as my base case, but I am pointing out the possibility.These are nervous and fickle markets on Wall Street. The so-called experts have very little conviction and they have one foot out the proverbial door. We are near all-time highs, so they will sell their positions first without asking questions.If you own JD stock for a fast trade, I'd suggest setting up your stops below $25.25 per share. But if you're in it for the long term, then I'd ignore these short-term gyrations for as long as the macroeconomic conditions are this good. We are fully employed and we have central banks committed to fuel the fires. They say to not fight the Fed, so I expect stocks to climb this wall of worry with sporadic dips.  * 7 Top-Rated Vanguard ETFs to Buy in 2019 It is crucial to note that this is not December. Last year ended in a Christmas crash because sentiment was horrendous. This time the Fed has flipped from a foe to friend and an ally to stocks. They will rescue Wall Street.The long-term viability of a competitor like JD.com has its critics. They compare it to AMZN so they wrongly assume that it's going to fail. Amazon proved that the world wants to transact online. That's why they gutted the brick and mortar retail industry. This trend is still in its infancy and there is no turning back. So there will be room for many competitors of all sizes that will thrive for decades to come.JD.com has a legitimate shot at being one of them and for as long as they deliver growth, investors should give them a pass on profitability.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Results will be choppy until the chasm is crossed. How long that will take is anyone's guess. Some don't even think Apple will cross it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares that traded as high as $220 last year, and for less than $150 at the start of 2019, were due to open June 10 at $190. That's a market cap of $875 billion. By comparison, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), has sailed past $1 trillion and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now at $888 billion. Apple BrowningCut into an Apple and it will start to brown at the cut. Rot, in nature or in business, can appear quickly, unless innovation is obvious.Apple today isn't seen as an innovator. The iPhone was announced in 2007, and sales peaked in 2015. This product has consistently represented over half Apple's revenue since 2013.This is why Apple sales are down this year, but not by nearly as much as iPhone sales. Services, increasingly delivered by Apple's own cloud, have taken up some of the slack.This has become a primary focus, with Apple getting into TV, payments, gaming and news subscriptions. But with 20% growth adding less than what's lost with reduced iPhone sales, analysts have become dissatisfied. Only half now have it as a buy, and three even say sell it. The Next Gold MineAs baby boomers continue to age, and as health care costs continue to increase, Apple has a new gold mine ready to open. Things like games, news and even TV are just placeholders.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 It's because of the Apple Watch that CEO Tim Cook has begun emphasizing privacy, and dissing fellow cloud czars Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in public statements.That's because the Apple Watch can save lives. It's not yet a full-fledged health device, and there are plenty of doctors claiming it can't be trusted in that way.But it doesn't have to be.That's because three-quarters of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health bill involves chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes.Even at its present, primitive level, Apple helps in cardiology, telling patients when they need to see a doctor for detailed tests.The big money will come from monitoring sugar levels. Apple has been working toward this for years and there are external devices that connect to the Watch. Getting monitoring into the Watch, making it non-invasive, is the next step.Diabetes was a $327 billion market in 2017, up from $245 billion in 2012, and 67% of that cost is paid by government. Even small improvements in diabetes monitoring can create big dividends. And then you have the Watch, for getting more services. The Bottom Line on AAPL StockChasing Apple when it's high will still cost you money because the topping-out of the iPhone market will continue to drive negative headlines.Instead accumulate it slowly, when everyone is dissing Apple, as in early May, and put it away. Once the gold mine is open, probably in two to three years, your patience will be rewarded, as it was with the iPhone.The Apple Cloud has not yet begun to produce its rain.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2492,0.9903,"If you're new to investing, one of the best ways you can dip your toe into the water is to buy a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in all 505 of the S&P 500's stocks. Your first question: What is the S&P 500? Your second question: How come there are 505 stocks, not 500? Both are relatively painless questions to answer.First, the S&P 500 represents 500 of the largest and most established companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange. You're likely familiar with many of the index's constituents. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500's largest company by market capitalization [share price multiplied by number of shares outstanding] is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at $1.02 trillion.    Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, has said that most investors should simplify their investments to deliver better long-term returns. He put it this way in his 2013 annual letter to shareholders:&quot;My advice [to the trustee] couldn't be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) …I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors -- whether pension funds, institutions or individuals -- who employ high-fee managers.&quot;Low costs and few moving parts wins the game in the long run.The second question requires much less legwork. There are 505 stocks in the index because some of the companies, such as Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), have more than one class of shares, which means Berkshire Hathaway counts as two holdings, not one.Simple, right?  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Now that I've answered the two questions, I better cut to the chase by providing readers with a short list of easy ways to buy S&P 500 stocks. Option No. 1: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)The oldest ETF in the U.S. -- launched in 1993 --  is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). It also happens to be the biggest with $260 billion in assets. As you probably expected, it has 500 holdings, but you may be surprised to hear that the SPY ETF currently pays you a dividend yield of 1.9% to hold it. And that's all for the expense ratio of 0.09%, or $9 per $10,000 invested per year.However, remember what Buffett said about low-cost funds. It's not the cheapest of the ETFs tracking the S&P 500, but it is the most popular. And it has stood the test of time. Option No. 2: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)Source: Shutterstock Two of the next three largest U.S.-listed ETFs also invest in every one of the S&P 500 stocks -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) has $110 billion in assets and charges 0.03%. This used to be 0.04%, until Vanguard cut the fees on three of its most popular products -- including the VOO ETF.As Vanguard's literature points out, this fund is &quot;more appropriate for long-term goals where your money's growth is essential.&quot; It makes a great base holding.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Clocking in at the VOO ETF's old expense ratio of 0.04% is the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV) with $178 billion in assets. These each give you plenty of choice when it comes to capturing a significant portion of American equities. Option No. 3 - Buy Buffett's Stock (BRK.B)Source: Shutterstock Berkshire Hathaway has often been compared to a very large mutual fund because it owns $203 billion worth of publicly traded stocks, most of them part of the S&P 500.However, in addition to the equities, you get a small piece of hundreds of private companies operating in all kinds of different sectors of the economy. The best part: Buffett won't charge you annual fees to own his fund. He'll just deliver long-term returns that handily beat the S&P 500. From 1965 to 2017, Berkshire Hathaway stock's generated a compound annual growth rate of 20.5%, more than double the S&P 500. As Warren Buffett suggests, you ought to do it early and often and at the lowest cost possible.These three options plus mutual funds that track the S&P 500 index (they're slightly more expensive than ETFs) will get the job done while letting you sleep easier at night.

Monday&apos;s early climb for the price-weighted Dow was buttressed by gains in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Apple Inc. .",0.0,0.775,0.225,1

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher for a fourth consecutive day, adding 1.02%.Comments from President Donald Trump regarding Mexico potentially avoiding the trade tariffs set to go into effect next week were among the catalysts for stocks today. Trump is pushing Mexico to buy more from U.S. farmers, saying that if Mexico cooperates, tariffs could be avoided.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately,&quot; Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, reports CNBC. &quot;If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!&quot; Talking TechThe Dow Jones Industrial Average allocates 18.71% of its weight to the technology sector, its second-largest sector exposure behind industrials. Five of the Dow's 30 stocks are tech names and those five stocks were among the blue-chip index's top seven percentage gainers today.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the Dow's top performer today as the stock jumped 2.8%, reclaiming its status in the $1 trillion market value club while ascending to an all-time high. Earlier this week, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler noted Microsoft's cloud business could eventually generate $140 billion in revenue. The analyst has an &quot;outperform rating on Microsoft stock.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Dow's largest tech holding, joined the party, adding 2.66%. Apple's Friday rally appears to be a sympathy play as the stock traded higher alongside the broad market, not on the back of company-specific news. There was some bullish analyst chatter on Apple stock yesterday along with rumors that the company is considering an acquisition to bolster its footprint in the fast-growing autonomous vehicle market.Outside of tech, United HealthGroup (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare stock in the Dow and one of the index's worst-performing components this year, enjoyed a decent day Friday, gaining 2.05% to put a dent into a year-to-date loss of almost 3%. On Thursday, UnitedHealth declared a quarterly dividend of $1.08 per share, up from the previous quarter's payout of 90 cents a share.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continued its assault on the record books, hitting another all-time high after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the fast food giant with a $220 price target, implying decent upside from Friday's close around $206.&quot;The company has generated strong growth in international markets, and though its traffic has been down in the U.S., its same-store sales have easily outperformed competitors as customers pay higher prices and order more add-ons,&quot; according to Restaurant Business. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHeading into Friday, it was expected that the May jobs report would miss expectations and do so in a big way. Still, it is encouraging to see riskier assets, such as stocks, handle that number with aplomb. There is still plenty of June, but the Dow closed the first week of a month that is historically rough on stocks on a four-day winning streak.Traders likely bid stocks higher today because the weak jobs number stoked hope that if the economy slows, the Federal Reserve could step in with interest rate cuts. In fact, bond markets are now pricing in as many as three rate cuts this year, with one possibly coming as soon as next month.It remains to be seen whether or not the Fed will pursue any rate cuts this year, so monitoring President Trump's Twitter feed for trade updates may help investors get a sense for where stocks are headed next week.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

The move comes off a less-than-stellar jobs report, as investors' hopes for further rate cuts fuel stock prices higher. Let's look at some top stock trades ahead of next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Amazon  Click to EnlargeShares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are showing a nice lift on Friday, up 2.6%. In fact, other large cap companies are too, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also moving nicely. Interestingly, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is not, which we'll get to in a moment.That $1,700 breakout level we were watching held for the most part this week. We've quickly seen a $100 rally in AMZN, as the market has been surging over the past few day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Shares are now running into downtrend resistance and the 20-day moving average. A push through this level could trigger a run to the 50-day. Should it act as resistance, I want to see if the 200-day moving average acts as support. If it does, AMZN will form a higher low, a bullish technical development. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Alphabet  Click to EnlargeGOOGL on the other hand, hasn't been acting so well. While it finally took out this week's highs on Friday, it's not doing so in convincing fashion. Consider how strong the Nasdaq has been all week, and short of Friday, how pathetic GOOGL stock has been trading.Now into the gap though and perhaps this one can gain some upside momentum. If downtrend resistance doesn't knock it back down, I want to see if Alphabet can fill the gap up to $1,100.Should GOOGL lose Monday's opening levels near $1,065, then the $1,035-ish lows are back on the table. Shares flirted with these lows all week and ultimately found buyers each time. Below here could get us a dip down to $1,000.If the markets fade next week, GOOGL may too. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Beyond Meat  Click to EnlargeOne of the market's biggest fascinations right now is Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), which is up 36% on better-than-expected earnings. However, don't be fooled. While this name can continue higher, it's mainly due to the very low share count currently available for trade as it's a recent IPO.Currently floating at new highs, BYND can continue higher if buyers keep pushing it. On a pullback, see if prior channel resistance near $120 can support it.If not, a pullback to $105 may be in order, which is prior range resistance. Below that and $95 is on the table, with the 38.2% retracement near $93. Further, the upward trending 20-day moving average is just below around $92. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: FedEx  Click to EnlargeHow ugly has FedEx (NYSE:FDX) been? Answer: Very.FedEx was in the news on Friday after it opted not to renew its Express U.S. service with Amazon.If we're giving FedEx the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; treatment, we can say that it already broke out of downtrend resistance (thin purple line). However, I have FDX in the &quot;prove it&quot; camp instead, because it's chart has been so dreadful. Therefore in my eyes, shares are still stuck in a downtrend (thick purple line).The stock has put in a double bottom at $150 and its MACD (blue circle) indicates that bulls are gaining momentum.Yet FDX just has too many trends going from the upper left to the lower right. Over downtrend resistance gets us to the 20-day. Over that gets us to $170, which I expect to act as resistance. At least on the first test.If $150 breaks to the downside, FDX is in no man's land. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Docusign  Click to EnlargeI covered Docusign's (NASDAQ:DOCU) earnings plunge, arguing that the selloff seems like an overreaction.Below key support between $50 and $52, as well as the 61.8% retracement at $47.78, and we said it was possible for DOCU stock to drop into the $45 area. On the plus side, it didn't have to go quite that low to find buyers. Even better, it reclaimed the 61.8% mark.So now what?I would love to see DOCU stock reclaim the $50 mark and its 200-day moving average. If it can, perhaps it can fight back into its prior range and give its 50-day moving average a test.

That means the countdown is on…  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Stumped for gift ideas? A turntable is old-school, but cool. On the other hand, traditional gifts like a tie, or a mug, or maybe a pen are old-school but not in a good way. If your dad has a leaning toward high-tech, we've put together a list of 10 Father's Day gift ideas that are sure to make his day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Calaway Epic Flash DriverSource: Calaway If dad's a golfer, he'll appreciate the boost his game would get with Calaway's $529.99 Epic Flash Driver.The company says this driver's design is the first to employ artificial intelligence and machine learning, with computers designing 15,000 virtual prototypes before hitting gold. The driver's unique face results in faster ball speed and greater distance, while a sliding weight offers adjustable ball control. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Tivoli Andiamo Bluetooth SpeakerSource: Brad Moon Andiamo is Italian for &quot;let's go&quot; and that's the point behind the Tivioli Andiamo Bluetooth speaker. Dad can take it wherever he wants to listen to music.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Despite an affordable $199.99 price tag, the Tivioli Andiamo has a premium look and feel that makes it stand out from most other portable wireless speakers. Instead of a variation on black plastic rectangle, this one is a short cylinder crafted of aluminum with leather trim and handle. It has 20-hour battery life and like all things Tivoli, it offers high quality sound with a touch of warmth. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Kenyon Frontier Portable Electric GrillSource: Kenyon Grilling is one of those traditional dad activities. The Kenyon Frontier Portable Electric Grill adds a whole new element to dad's cooking repertoire.This is an electric grill and thanks to Kenyon's advanced engineering, it doesn't give off smoke. Even when searing meat at temperatures high enough to leave perfect grill marks (yes, I used a Frontier for the photo at the start of this post). That means dad can grill indoors during inclement weather, or take the Frontier outside to use on a balcony. It quickly reaches temperatures as high as 550 degrees, doesn't require air-polluting fuel, and it's easy to clean -- the grill plate and lid can both be tossed in the dishwasher!With prices starting at $895.50 this isn't a cheap grill, but it's incredibly versatile, cleverly designed and constructed with marine-grade stainless steel for long life.  Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Biolite HeadLamp 330Source: Biolite Every dad needs a good flashlight, but the problem with handheld versions is they require a hand to hold them, making it tough to get effective lighting when working on something. The BioLite HeadLamp 330 is a high-tech solution to hands-free lighting.  * 5 Healthcare Stocks to Pick Up From the Wreckage Unlike most head-mounted lights, the $49.95 HeadLamp 330 sits flush on the forehead, so it won't slip. The light is bright at 330 Lumens, and it can tilt down. The headband is moisture-wicking fabric (available in four different colors), battery life ranges from 3.5 hours (high) to 40 hours (low), and it's rechargeable using USB. This is the perfect head light for projects, hiking, camping or for use in power outages. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Yamaha MusicCast VINYL 500 Wi-Fi TurntableSource: Brad Moon Remember earlier when it was mentioned that turntables are old-school but cool? The $699.95 Yamaha MusicCast VINYL 500 Wi-Fi Turntable takes this to another level by mixing in the latest streaming technology.The VINYL 500 can be used as a standard turntable. There's a built-in pre-amp, so it can be connected to virtually any music system. But add a pair of Yamaha's wireless MusicCast speakers, and dad can listen to his records anywhere in the house -- without the compression of Bluetooth. It also supports multi-room audio. The turntable itself also connects to online streaming music services like Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), so it truly becomes the hub of a wireless audio streaming setup. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Denon Envaya DSB-250BTSource: Denon If dad's a bit of a music snob, the $199 Denon Envaya DSB-250BT portable Bluetooth speaker makes a great gift. It doesn't look like anything extraordinary, although it does sport an attractive cloth weave covering over the rubberized black finish.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets But it's made by Denon and that means impressive sound. When I reviewed it, I was amazed by just how much bass this compact speaker can put out. At 2 x 13W of power, it can get impressively loud as well. And it's also IP67 water resistant, so it can take being dropped in water. Perfect for the back yard, deck, beach, pool or cottage. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Moment Smartphone LensesSource: Moment Moment has built a reputation as the go-to accessory maker if you want to update a smartphone to DSLR-like capabilities. The company makes Photo Cases for popular smartphones including Samsung's Galaxy series and the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone.Some of the cases look pretty cool on their own, but the magic is the lens mounts over the camera cutout. Moment makes a range of different lenses, including telephoto, wide angle, macro and anamorphic option, all using precision optics. Prices vary depending on case type and lens, but the company is currently selling starter sets -- with a Photo Case, Lens, Lens Cap and Lens Pen starting at $149.96 with free delivery. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: Leather Coat From The Jacket MakerA leather coat would make a great Father's Day gift, but what makes it high-tech?Source: The Jacket Maker When you order from The Jacket Maker you can choose from hundreds of styles and colors, but from there you can customize the fit so it is absolutely perfect for dad. Even better, you can modify the basic design. The company made me one that included pockets that were specially designed to hold the gadgets I typically carry around, including an iPhone, battery pack and a Moment camera lens.   * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Prices vary depending on the coat, but I found them competitive with retail stores and shipping is free. Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: AirThinx IAQ Air Quality MonitorSource: AirThinx The AirThinx AIQ is a great safety feature to have for your home. This professional grade air quality monitor can detect and measure a variety of factors that affect air quality including CO2 levels, humidity, formaldehyde and particulate matter like fungi and pollen. The data can be accessed online or using the AirThinx mobile app. Spikes and patterns in the data can help to pinpoint issues like a furnace in need of maintenance.Buying outright costs $699 plus a $29 monthly fee, but if dad has any concerns about air quality, the peace of mind is likely worth it. And the AirThinx data will help him to track down any issues.   Father's Day Gift Ideas 2019: OICA Liddup CoolerSource: Brad Moon Coolers and dads go hand in hand. There's no such thing as a back yard cookout, a beach day or a camping trip without a cooler. Treat dad to an ORCA Liddup cooler and he'll be the envy of whatever event he's attending.  * 10 High-Tech Grad Gifts for 2019 The $299.99 ORCA Liddup is no ordinary cooler. This is a premium, rotomolded cooler. It's heavy, solid as a rock and it keeps contents cold for a long time. It can be used as a seat when chairs are in short supply. It's made in the USA -- as you can see from the American flag badging proudly mounted on the front of the cooler. And it's bear-resistant. That's all great, but this is also a high-tech cooler. Open the lid, and LED lights (powered by four AA batteries) illuminate the contents so dad can see what's he's fishing for in the dark without needing a flashlight. Genius.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2574,0.9821,"The opening of antitrust investigations by U.S. authorities into select tech stocks aren't going to reach any verdicts anytime soon. In today's market though, the price charts of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are showing signs of acquittals for some bulls and imprisonment for others.Finally, trade wars with China and Mexico took a back seat this week for four of the country's largest tech stocks. But Monday's surprise wake-up call that the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department are readying to investigate AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL and FB was anything but a reprieve. Shares collectively hit fresh relative lows and losses ranged from about 1% to 7.5%, respectively.In a nutshell, authorities are looking at each company's unique, but dominant digital platforms, which have hindered competition for consumers and determined whether any punitive measures or even the breaking up of these companies is required. It sounds grim to say the least, but is it really?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Despite the immediate bearish judgment from Wall Street, any future verdicts, good or bad, will also take a lot of time to render. Everything else is 100% pure conjecture. In the interim and in the here and now, it's simply business as usual on the price charts of these tech stocks and where verdicts are being handed out in favor of both bulls and bears in today's market. Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeOn the antitrust news, AAPL stock demonstrated the most resiliency with its relatively modest loss of around 1% and holding the 62% retracement level. Shares have also continued to show strength this week in rallying strongly to their highest prices in three weeks. Our verdict however on this tech stock is bearish.Apple was one of the weaker tech stocks in the group prior to the antitrust news. Now and with shares in-between resistance from the 200-day simple moving average and 50% retracement level and stochastics overbought, the interpretation is this week's price action may be little more than a bear market rally.Sentencing: Short AAPL stock if zone resistance is confirmed by a bearish daily chart reversal pattern next week. Amazon (AMZN)  Click to EnlargeTechnically, after holding the larger corrective base's 50% retracement level, AMZN shares are now firmly above the 200SMA and sporting a more supportive stochastics set-up, I'd be a cautious buyer in this name.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Sentencing: Buy AMZN stock on a pullback towards 200SMA support with a stop-loss below $1,738. Alphabet (GOOGL)  Click to EnlargeGOOGL stock has been both the strongest and weakest name since December 2018's broad-based market bottom. After making a marginally new all-time-high at the end of April, shares are the closest of our four stocks to its prior lows. Similarly, they're also setting up nicely as a contrarian-based buy.Sentencing: I'm a buyer of this tech stock's exhaustion gap and island-style price pattern, which is reinforced by positive divergence in GOOGL's stochastics. Shares look ready for purchase today with a stop-loss beneath the pattern bottom. Facebook (FB)  Click to EnlargeTechnically, I like that FB stock held the 200SMA and 50% level at this week's low. And stochastics are looking mostly supportive of the bull case.Off the price chart, I can't help but think of the four names targeted by authorities, Facebook is also the weakest or least likely for any charges to stick. What are they going to charge the company with? Too many people sharing stories and pictures on Facebook and Instagram?  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Sentencing: Buy this tech stock if FB shares can confirm a weekly chart hammer candlestick next week by trading above the pattern high. Set a stop-loss beneath the pattern bottom.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2575,-0.9788,"Cash -- one of the last vestiges of the analog era -- is steadily going out of style. This broad trend only helps credit card companies with mass appeal, such as Visa (NYSE:V). Although you'll often hear personal finance gurus urging their listeners to cut up their plastic, let's be real: Americans love debt-based consumerism. That simple fact should lift Visa stock northward on a longer-term basis.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrAdding to the bullish case, this scenario is playing out exactly as I stated. On a year-to-date basis, V stock is up nearly 28%. Credit card rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is enjoying a similar burst in sentiment, gaining a massive 38% year-to-date. Compare these performances to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is up only 14% YTD after suffering volatility since May.And what is the source of this volatility? Just turn on the TV to find out. A few weeks back, everybody was scrambling to decipher underlying signals within the deteriorating complex of U.S.-China relations. Now, President Trump has his eyes focused on Mexico, threatening painful tariffs unless they control migrant inflows. But while all this is going on, the Visa stock price remains elevated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Like our own Ian Bezek stated in October 2017, V stock is surprisingly recession-resistant. Visa doesn't assume credit risk in the way that a mortgage lender might.Plus, the world community is undergoing a transition to financial digitalization. One of physical cash's final holdouts, Japan, is slowly but steadily shifting toward a cashless society. As a western ally and the world's third-biggest economy, converting Japan is huge for companies like Square (NYSE:SQ). Through natural synergies, you can also expect a swing higher in the Visa stock price.Yet I'm cautious, and here's why: Visa Stock Has Serious VulnerabilitiesThe last time I wrote about V stock, I compared the underlying company to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Making headlines earlier this year, Apple announced its foray into the plastic industry.However, I felt that Visa's broad base, and its decades of expertise in the arena gave it the advantage. I'm still sticking to that narrative.But since writing that piece, the U.S. is on the verge of entering a two-front trade war. Going toe-to-toe with China is bad enough. Simultaneously antagonizing Mexico is a very risky political move for the Trump administration. Obviously, if the situation worsens, it will threaten several jobs.And that's why with this new information, I'm hesitant on Visa stock. Earlier, Bezek mentioned that company shares mitigated losses better in the 2008 fallout relative to many other stocks. That suggests the American consumer is much more resilient than we give it credit for.But another scenario is that consumers used whatever tools at their disposal to keep the rusted train going. Consumer debt statistics indicate that, contrary to the &quot;recovery&quot; narrative, most Americans are deeply troubled. People with credit cards average over $5,800 in debt.Some states are much worse. For instance, Alaska has the most average credit card debt at $8,500 per cardholder. Iowa features the lowest, but still maintains a staggering $5,155 of plastic debt.All you need to do when considering the risk to the Visa stock price is read between the lines. People have no reason to hold such mind-boggling balances in their high-interest rate cards other than cash flow purposes. In order to make ends meet, Americans individually kick the can down the road.V stock has been rising because we've had plenty of road to cover. But these new geopolitical headwinds are too ominous to ignore. Excessive Bad Loans Cloud V StockAdmittedly, our spiraling relations with foreign economic partners got me to question the true state of our own economy. After all, President Trump won because he tapped into the actual fears affecting voters.In other words, Trump called Obama-era data &quot;fake news.&quot; Millions believed him.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Now, Trump as President is changing his tune. Rather than fake news, positive labor reports and consumer sentiment represent confirmation that his policies work. But the reality is that Trump was probably right the first time. Certainly, rising consumer debt levels support the pessimistic narrative.What bothers me more is that this narrative has other confirming indicators. For instance, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are only gaining due to issues involving monetary policy. However, they are not generating revenue growth from activities like lending or consulting.Put differently, Americans are not taking on good debt. By that, I mean debt for the purpose of starting new businesses or ventures. Instead, we're seeing an increase in bad debt, or liabilities associated with purchasing junk.What I'm talking about probably won't impact the Visa stock price immediately. But considering that it's so elevated right now, I'd stay on the sidelines with the powder keg dry.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Earlier today, the European Central Bank (ECB) said it plans to keep interest rates on hold longer than market participants previously expected.Source: Shutterstock That was a nice addition to some dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week and enough to propel U.S. equities higher Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 added 0.53% and 0.61% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its winning streak to three days, rising 0.71%.Three consecutive days of gains for the Dow Jones is nothing to scoff at, but an imminent test looms in the form of the May jobs report, due out Friday before the open of U.S. markets. Following the tepid ADP private payrolls data out earlier this week, traders could be bracing for a disappointing number tomorrow morning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTraders may already be preparing for such disappointment as gold finished higher Thursday for a seventh straight day. That's good for bullion's best winning streak in a over a year.Focusing on Thursday's action, the Dow got some important contributions from a recently downtrodden sector. Energetic Energy NamesIn this order, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are the two largest U.S. oil companies. In this order, Chevron and Exxon were two of top three percentage gainers in the Dow on Thursday.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Strength in those Dow components arrived a day after oil prices officially slipped into a bear market and with the S&P 500 Energy Index entering Thursday with a second-quarter loss of nearly 9%. There was not a lot of company-specific news pertaining to the two U.S. oil giants today, indicating the rally in the pair was likely a symptom of oil prices bouncing back today.Late Wednesday, Exxon said it plans to make additional investments at an offshore block off Angola, which could take production at the block to 40,000 barrels per day once fully operational.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another important contributor to the Dow' Jones today, rising 1.47% after Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani called the stock undervalued based on the potential of the company's services and iPhone businesses. Daryanani initiated coverage of Apple with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and a $205 price target.&quot;We believe the stock is undervalued at these levels,&quot; Daryanani wrote in a note cited by Barron's. &quot;From a business-line perspective, we believe the company can continue drive strong momentum in services while increasing average selling prices to partially offset iPhone unit declines.&quot;Shares of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) climbed almost 1% after Citigroup reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the stock while boosting its price target on the theme park and entertainment conglomerate to $160 from $132, implying significant upside from current levels. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe Dow Jones is cobbling together some nice gains this week, but as was noted earlier, the May jobs report coming tomorrow represents a significant near-term test for riskier assets.In addition to the aforementioned winning streak for gold, there is another defensive-related element to consider. Of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hitting all-time highs today, 13 were real estate and utilities funds, indicating investors are still favoring lower beta sectors. And that all-time figure does not include several low-volatility funds that are heavy on those two defensive sectors.Gains are gains, but it would be encouraging to see some of the market's more cyclical sectors reestablish leadership.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2624,-0.9358,"Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been going through some turbulence lately. Issues with its 737 MAX led to a global grounding of the aircraft. Worse, Boeing's best-selling aircraft saw its orders completely dry up, leaving Boeing stock floundering amid a market correction.Source: Shutterstock However, many investors realize that the issue can be fixed. While it's a short-term bump, it won't hurt Boeing's long-term trajectory. Case in point? The aircraft maker is in talks with Chinese airlines for a jet deal that is valued in the tens of billions. The DealAccording to reports, Boeing and Chinese airlines are in discussion for about 100 new 787 Dreamliner and 777X jets. Specifically, the two sides are in discussions for Boeing's newest long-range jet, which is the 777-9. The latter is also Boeing's most expensive, ringing in at $442.2 million before discounts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, there are some complications.The airlines are waiting for guidance from the Chinese government, as the U.S. and China remain locked in an ongoing trade war. While the discussions between Chinese airlines and Boeing may look like a positive for the trade war, that's not so much the case. The deal is not imminent and while it seems unlikely that it will fall apart unless the trade situation deteriorates immensely, it could certainly be on hold for a while.The trade war is inflicting pain on both sides. U.S. farmers are being compensated, China's economy is seeing some waves and how many retailers did we hear from regarding the trade war? PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) are just a few that come to mind.A delayed deal for Boeing may not result in the same impact retailers feel. But make no mistake, dragging out this deal doesn't help. At the end of the day, China needs aircraft and is almost a decade away from its own production. That leaves Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY). Before discounts are taken into consideration, the deal is said to be north of $30 billion. Boeing wants to land it -- of course -- and Chinese airlines need it. But until the trade-war tensions ease, it may not come to fruition for a bit. Trading Boeing Stock Price  Click to EnlargeEventually though, the deal should go through and Boeing will go back to what it does best: generating massive cash flow. If it also clears its 737 MAX issues, investors will have two sighs of relief and even more reason to back the company. Will that cause Boeing stock to rally? Most likely. But it still has some short-term issues.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets On the chart above, notice how $360 buoyed the name for a while (orange arrow). At the same time though, notice how BA stock was not able to push through its 10-week moving average. The same goes for its 50-day moving average, which isn't shown on this weekly chart.Eventually, $360 -- which was prior range resistance -- gave way and is again acting as is resistance. So are the 50-week and 200-day moving averages. With prior range resistance no longer acting as support, we have to put prior range support down near $320 back on the table.That doesn't mean Boeing stock will fall that far necessarily. But if the markets begin to selloff or BA stock slips on negative headlines, this area will be on watch. Over $360 negates a lot of the negativity and puts a move back to $400 on the table.I think eventually Boeing stock will get back to $400 and eventually back to that prior high near $443. Maybe that comes on the back of a 737 MAX fix. Perhaps a mega deal with Chinese airlines helps drive there. More than likely, it will need both catalysts. That said, a flush lower may still be in the cards before BA stock gets there.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2636,0.9992,"Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019 It has since been updated and republished.Did you know that stock buybacks were illegal until 1982? It's true.Source: Shutterstock The SEC, operating under the Reagan Republicans, passed rule 10b-18, which made stock buybacks legal. Up until the passing of this rule, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 considered large-scale share repurchases a form of stock manipulation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe 1982 rule provided &quot;safe harbor&quot; protection as long as a company bought back no more than 25% of its average daily volume over the previous four weeks and didn't buy its stock at the beginning or end of the day's trading. The SEC Commissioners argued at the time that the rule would encourage higher stock prices thereby benefiting investors across the board.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Care to guess who the SEC Chairman was in 1982? John Shad. John Shad was a former executive with E.F. Hutton. It seems odd that someone who worked for a company that directly benefited from the rule change (higher prices equals higher commissions) would be in charge of the agency created to protect investors. In hindsight, it seems like a massive conflict of interest, but I digress.The reality is that stock buybacks have helped the wealthiest 1% get even richer over the past 36 years. In 1982, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO earned 50 times the average production worker. Today, the CEO Pay Ratio's increased to 144 times the average worker with most of the gains a result of stock options and awards. Suggesting stock buybacks ought to be illegal isn't a crazy notion. Here are seven reasons why: Stock Buybacks Reward a Lack of Creativity and InnovationBy mid-December of 2018 following the corporate tax cut that was supposed to help the middle class, America's public companies had announced $1.1 trillion in stock buybacks with $800 billion already repurchased with only two weeks left in 2018. A record year by any standard.  Source: Shutterstock On the one hand, buybacks of this size make sense in a year that saw many stocks lose ground. On the other, 2018 was the first year of negative returns for the S&P 500 since 2008, making the latest bull market one of the longest in history.  In the eyes of many, stocks are overvalued, despite their retreat in 2018.Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ought to have better things to do with their cash than buying back billions of dollars in stock. It stifles creativity and innovation, something Apple's going to need if it wants to keep growing. &quot;I find it absolutely mind-numbing that a company like Apple can sit on $260 billion of cash,&quot; Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko told CNN recently. &quot;You're telling me that all these genius people can't think of one intelligent thing to do with that capital?&quot;  I'm a fan of Tim Cook and Apple, but stock buybacks are not the answer to the company's slowing innovation. Stock Buybacks Hurt the U.S. EconomyThis argument is a rather circuitous one so bear with me.CNN recently reported that America's total debt is nearly $22 trillion, an average of $67,000 per person. That's right; split between all U.S. citizens, you'd owe $67,000 for your share of America's debt. In 2019, America's bill for the interest on that debt is $383 billion; by 2025 it's projected to hit $928 billion or about the same amount as corporate stock buybacks in 2018. Imagine if the dollars directed to share repurchases were redirected to paying down the national debt. At the current pace of stock buybacks, the debt problem could be eliminated in 22 years. But of course, that wouldn't help the wealthiest 1%.Consider this: Many economists argued that the Trump tax cuts would worsen the debt situation and they were right. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Trump tax cuts would add $1.9 trillion in principal and interest to the deficit by 2027. Since Trump's become President, the national debt's increased by more than $2 trillion. Thus, the president and Congress face a difficult decision.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Increase taxes, cut spending or do a combination of both. Do nothing, and the deficit continues to increase, and the U.S. dollar risks becoming irrelevant on a global scale as its creditworthiness crumbles.Trump's plan was simple: Cut corporate taxes and the savings will be reinvested. The $1.1 trillion in stock buybacks in 2018 suggests that didn't happen. God help the common man if we go into recession in the next two years because there will be nothing available to reignite the economy. The cupboards will be bare.  Stock Buybacks Add to DebtloadThe previous reason why stock buybacks ought to be illegal had to do with the federal government's mishandling of an economy on the rise. I never thought the corporate tax cuts were a good idea.&quot;America's crumbling infrastructure isn't going to be fixed when the federal government's revenues are going the wrong way. President Donald Trump promised an infrastructure plan, but with lower revenues expected over the next decade, it will be tough for him to deliver,&quot; I wrote in December 2017. &quot;And don't for a minute expect private businesses to jump into the fight to save the day with their new-found wealth.&quot;They haven't. And won't. So, here we have a federal government drowning in debt, encouraging public companies to do the same through stock buybacks. Unfortunately, as bond guru Jeffrey Gundlach suggests, increasing stock buybacks reduces the solidity of a company's balance sheet. &quot;So, the balance sheets of corporations are balanced on ever-dwindling equities as they buy back shares and increase their leverage ratios. And that's not good,&quot; Gundlach stated in January. &quot;Strong balance sheets are going to be the way to survive during the zigzag of 2019.&quot;In Gundlach's estimation, strong balance sheets are far more critical than strong earnings.With 62% of investment grade debt maturing over the next five years, there are a lot of companies that are going to wish they didn't buy back so much stock.Stock Buybacks Reduce Capital SpendingAll businesses have one cash flow bucket. Cash goes in; cash goes out, the difference is the capital it can allocate for uses other than keeping the company running. These uses include debt repayment, dividends, stock buybacks, acquisitions, and investing in the future.Source: Shutterstock The Trump corporate tax cut was intended to put more money in corporate coffers so they could invest in the future creating more jobs. While the unemployment rate is healthier than it's ever been, it's unlikely that it was the result of increased capital spending. In the last two years of the Obama administration, five million jobs were created while 4.8 million were created in the first two years of Trump's presidency, suggesting that almost any economic strategy would have worked for the incoming president. According to Just Capital, 56% of the tax savings from the new corporate tax rate went to shareholders with just 24% allocated to wages and job creation. Just 8% went to improving products and innovating, and the remainder went to lower prices and community involvement. In 2018, the bucket spilled over for stock buybacks. Capital spending, not so much. Stock Buybacks Provide a False PictureThe main argument for stock buybacks is that the reduction in shares outstanding increases earnings per share which is the primary driver of higher share prices. A secondary consideration is that every shareholder gets a more significant piece of a smaller pie.It's no wonder, then, that Warren Buffett's a big fan of stock buybacks. Every time a company held by Buffett announces a $10 billion share repurchase program, he rubs his hands with glee because his ownership stake goes up without making an additional investment. It's the power of compounding in reverse. In 2014, I wrote an article entitled The 2 Biggest Lies of Buybacks. One paragraph sticks out for me to this day. &quot;The premise that buybacks boost earnings is a big fat lie. It's an optical illusion meant to distract investors from the truth: Bottom-line growth is measured by net income only and not earnings per share,&quot; I wrote in 2014. &quot;After all, you wouldn't judge top-line growth by anything other than revenue, would you?&quot;In the article, I used Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as an example of how buybacks hide the truth. Because it bought back 4.4 billion shares between 2009 and 2013, while its net earnings were down 28% that year, EPS were down a more palatable 15%. You can argue till the cows come home why I'm wrong, but a 28% decline is a 28% decline, no matter how many shares are outstanding. Stock Buybacks Create Income InequalityAs I pointed out in a previous slide, the period between 1982-2017 has created a much wider gap between the person at the top of the pyramid, the CEO, and the workers on the bottom.According to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, CEO pay between 1990 and 2016 increased by 438%. Meanwhile, according to the Pew Research Center, the average seasonally adjusted hourly wage in the U.S. between 1964 and 2018 grew by just 12% in constant 2018 dollars. The legalization of stock buybacks in 1982 gave CEOs a massive incentive for repurchasing their company's shares. Their pay packages went through the roof while the rank-and-file employees saw their wages barely budge. A rational person would see the causal link when it comes to income inequality. CEOs Love Stock BuybacksHey, if you're a CEO, I wouldn't blame you for taking advantage of the system. It's not your fault that the board of directors gave you such a lucrative compensation package. After all, they didn't have to. It's not as if you were holding a gun to their heads.Source: FlickrWho wouldn't like a pay package that grows and grows and grows without any additional effort? As a writer, I'd love to be able to get paid X dollars to write this article today, X dollars plus next year, and X dollars plus, plus, the year after that. It is not going to happen. But it happens every day for CEOs. Is it any wonder why they love stock buybacks?Let's take Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for example.In fiscal 2018, it repurchased 279 million shares of its stock for $22.6 billion. That alone would have a material effect on earnings per share, which is a significant factor in Qualcomm's annual cash incentive plan, as well as a considerable influence on both its performance stock unit and restricted stock unit awards. In fiscal 2018, CEO Steve Mollenkopf received total compensation of $20.0 million. The year before that it was $11.6 million and $11.1 million in fiscal 2016. Of Mollenkopf's total compensation, 86% was EPS-related to one extent or another. Do you think he's got an incentive to repurchase Qualcomm shares? I sure do.

2637,0.9781,"Sector diversification typically makes a good deal of sense. But when it comes to financial giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), on and off the price chart JPM stock is a buy and BAC stock is where you go to buy a Certificate of Deposit. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Buying a couple, or even a few, names within an area such as technology to reduce portfolio risk can make a great deal of sense. There is, of course, a big difference between owning a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and having exposure in another tech outfit such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).But for bank stocks like JPMorgan and Bank of America, there's simply too much redundancy to believe the power of diversification is a truly attractive strategy. In general, JPM and BAC stock will travel more or less in the same direction depending on various macro influences impacting the country's first and second largest banks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis view also means going long JPM stock and shorting BAC shares, without solid company-specific cause and similar to what we've seen the past couple years in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) or Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) probably isn't going to yield much as an investment play either.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets And when it comes to the price lines that investors use to gauge one company against another, in today's market JPM stock is a buy, while Bank of America is only good for locking in less bang for the buck. Bank Stock Buy: JPM StockOff the price chart, JPM stock, the country's largest bank by assets, continues to make all the right moves. In early April, the company easily topped profit and sales views. JPMorgan's report also offered investors broad-based growth in numerous units ranging from its loan portfolio business, credit card sales and advisory revenue to debt underwriting and surging investment banking sales, which hit all-time-highs.On the price chart, JPM stock is firing on all cylinders -- or as well as can be expected given the recent market hostilities tied to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.The weekly chart shows that by the end of April, after two separate corrective phases since early 2018, JPM stock had narrowly notched a higher all-time-high. The chart also shows during this past month's broad-based pullback that JPMorgan has put together a constructive higher low pivot to confirm the banker's uptrend.With the weekly candle pivot low receiving modest trade-through confirmation to the upside on Tuesday and JPM's stochastics beginning to turn higher in neutral territory, an investment in JPM stock looks good. But it looks even better on the daily chart.Tuesday's weekly confirmation also managed to reverse JPM stock's breach of its 200-day simple moving average. Given the well-watched technical level also lines up nicely with a price fill of JPM's earnings-driven price gap and test of the 38% retracement level--it's time to invest in this best of breed stock today. Bank Stock Hold: BAC StockOff the price chart BAC stock, the United States' second-biggest bank, delivered mixed results in its quarterly confessional back in mid-April. Bank of America managed to top and grow profit estimates by a slight margin, but sales narrowly missed views while also dropping from theAnd on the price chart, unlike JPM stock, the big picture is also a mixed bag for BAC stock investors.I like the weekly BAC stock chart for its Bollinger Band support, oversold stochastics and test of the 50% Fibonacci level. But I think we can all agree, along with the lower high pattern, BAC stock's price action is weaker and definitely earns it the number two spot here as well.BAC stock's daily price chart also paints a more precarious picture. Unlike JPM stock, we can see that while shares managed to score a new high for 2019, by the end of April, BAC is well beneath its earnings levels and in a testing position of 200-day simple moving average resistance. Regardless of what the Fed says later this month or what happens with the trade war, BAC stock doesn't look strong enough on its own merit to buy shares right now.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

When you factor in medical marijuana - a market that's already thriving in Illinois - the future is even brighter:  * $2.9 billion a year by 2024, projects Alliance Global Partners.&quot;Illinois is going to be huge,&quot; agrees the Brightfield Group, noting that Illinois will soon rival Colorado… a state with a more established industry - but only half the people.  * Governor Pritzker thinks legal marijuana will earn Illinois $170 million… just in the first year. There's no doubt that tax revenue is one reason states are jumping on the bandwagon. 4&#92;. This could be a huge job creator.Illinois is already home to several of the top cannabis companies, like Cresco Labs (OTCMKTS:CRLBF). And Cresco is planning to double its workforce there.From its home base in Chicago, Cresco has some pretty ambitious goals for expansion. In April came the news that it would purchase Origin House (OTCMKTS:ORHOF) for approximately $850 million.Cresco is already one of the biggest American cannabis companies, with $21.1 million in first-quarter revenues. But if you count its pending acquisitions of Origin House and VidaCann, Cresco would have made$33.9 million. Origin House might be based in Ontario -- but what it really does for Cresco is open up America's oldest and largest legal-weed market: California.That's just one example. And for us as investors, it's time to get on board this train -- or watch it pass us by.At Investment Opportunities, I'm closely monitoring stocks like Cresco for a potential buy. It's certainly a better bargain than most of the Canadian pot stocks.However, there are a few OTHER stocks that are attractive and still in &quot;penny stock&quot; territory. Why I Like Penny Pot Stocks Ahead of Full Marijuana LegalizationPenny stocks often get a bad rap. But they are actually critical to the global marketplace. The world needs tiny companies -- just as much as bigger ones. They're the job creators. The innovators. And they're the places to look for the biggest gains once marijuana legalization occurs.As an investor, if you're looking for the next Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this is where you'll find it.You just want to be VERY choosy about which ones you buy.I use strict guidelines to pick penny stocks -- and I tell you all about them in this presentation.When I used my five-step evaluation process on the marijuana market, I identified four stocks that are worth buying now.During my presentation, you'll have the opportunity to secure a free copy of America's Top 4 Marijuana Moonshot Stocks… I'll even give you a fifth bonus name just for fun.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2701,0.9918,"While June has not been kind to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock so far, time will attest that it's a gem in disguise. Every now and then, we get a stock that is a sure thing, and Google stock fits the bill.Source: Shutterstock This is a company that completely revolutionized the way the world uses the internet. I remember the early days when I had to explain to my friends what &quot;Googling it&quot; meant. Now it's the behemoth of search, among other things.The Monday madness made for a perfect place to go long in GOOGL stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompanies that are so successful become vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the high profile modern example of this. Now it's GOOGL's turn.For years we've seen the headlines of fines from the E.U., but more recently the attacks came onshore. The U.S. political rhetoric took a step up since the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Cambridge Analytica incident. Now, attacking the mega-cap corporations has become a popular soapbox for politicians to run their campaigns.But, on Monday, this took a wild turn.We had a flurry of headlines targeting GOOGL, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and FB. This caused the Nasdaq Composite to fall 2.2% as the FANG and AAPL collective, which makes up about half of the index, fell 5%.  * 7 Small-Cap ETFs to Buy Now Those who went long puts into GOOGL and AMZN fears Monday made a fast profit as the turnaround came quickly after on Tuesday.. For example, if you sold the GOOGL March 2020 $800 put or the January AMZN 1200 puts, then you profited $6 per contract in a matter of hours.But is the rally over? No. The opportunity is still available.The FANG collective fell 5% on Monday, but the bounce was only 2% on Tuesday. So there is plenty of short-term upside left, but, more importantly, there is plenty of long-term upside in GOOGL stock.The important part of this bullish thesis is that as big as Google is, it is only monetizing one aspect of its operations. It still has billions of active users that are ripe for the picking. So the upside potential is massive.This is not to mention other ventures that are outside of its current scope. Take Waymo for example. This is the company that will probably be first to bring autonomous driving to the world. Google owns it so they have a front seat to that new world. Imagine the applications that GOOGL software can incorporate into those for its brands and competitors.From that perspective, GOOGL is starting to resemble AMZN except at a fraction of the cost. Google sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25X, which is three times cheaper than that of AMZN. This is nothing against AMZN, but the point is to highlight the bargain that Google stock is now. This is a position I would hold for the long term.In the short term, there will be dips. The one from Monday was atypical, but even then, it was not a reason for investors to panic out of the stock. Trading around the Alphabet stock levels shorter term is also okay, but not everyone is that savvy.I prefer boring, high odds trades and Alphabet stock offers me that opportunity. I can buy the shares and hold for the future, or I can sell puts at lower levels and collect the premiums so I don't even need a rally to profit.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far  How to Approach Google Stock TodayToday, I can even do both. I buy half a position of stock and sell the other half in puts or put spreads. This gives me some cushion to withstand the short-term headline risks that are littering the headlines.President Trump is still in a heated economic war with China, so stocks are vulnerable to wild swings but the overall macroeconomic thesis is still bullish. We have full employment and near zero interest rates. And the global central banks are all committed to fueling the economic fire.Only a black swan event can ruin this setup and these can happen at any time, so we can't plan for them. When we invest in any asset, we accept that unknown event risk … otherwise, there would be no reward.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2702,0.9988,"This week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that it is shutting down iTunes. It will be replaced with a music app, among other things. Over the years, iTunes has gradually shifted from a killer piece of software to a bloated and frustrating mess. Still, iTunes shutting down marks the end of an era and also raises a pressing question for AAPL stock.Source: Apple Will Apple be able to regain its leadership position in digital media?Or has it been left permanently in the dust by more nimble rivals such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) in music and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in video?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips iTunes, A Key Part of Apple's RevivalApple launched the first version of iTunes just months before it started selling its iconic iPods. Young readers may not recall, but it was in fact the iPod, not the iPhone, that saved Apple from its disastrous decline at the turn of the century. The iPhone would lead AAPL stock to glorious heights. But none of it would have been possible without the synergistic iPod and iTunes combo paving the way.  * The 10 Biggest Announcements From Apple WWDC 2019 In 2003, iTunes made a huge leap forward by beginning to sell music. Until that point, it was virtually impossible for a consumer to legally purchase from a variety of record labels. With the iTunes digital store, people could finally buy everything they'd find in a record store -- and more -- without breaking the law.While the music industry continued to slump, iTunes helped slow down the crippling wave of music piracy. For a decade or so, it enjoyed boom times. The record labels were happy to have another source of revenue, and people enjoyed access to virtually all recorded music in just a few clicks.Over time, Apple built on the success of the iTunes store, adding other products as well. For awhile, it managed to sell a great number of movies. It even had a robust business selling individual TV episodes often for $1.99 a pop. Apple, not surprisingly, collected a huge chunk of these digital media revenues. Back then, a hot music single, for example, could sell hundreds of thousands a copy a week. Apple generated a great deal of incremental revenue from this. Apple Misses the Rise of SubscriptionsHowever, as good as the good times were for the iTunes store, they weren't meant to last. Here, interestingly, is a fine question of former CEO Steve Jobs' strategic intuition. In 2003, he said that listeners &quot;Didn't want to rent their music.&quot; About the subscription model for music, he said it simply &quot;doesn't fly with customers&quot;.After Jobs' passing, Apple dutifully stuck with the own, not rent, model for music, movies and other digital media. However, one would have to wonder if Jobs would have figured out that consumer preferences had changed in time for Apple to assume a leadership position in the new playing field. Tim Cook certainly didn't. His oversight has left the company in a far worse position as media has transitioned from digital ownership to subscription models.In 2014, Apple acquired Beats Electronics, which included the fledging music service which was later to become Apple Music. Alas, this move was years too late. Spotify had launched years ago, and was already picking up considerable momentum as its American listener base took off. Apple Stuck Playing Catch-UpWith iTunes and the iPod, Apple basically created the digital music scene. There were a few MP3 players before the iPod but they had grave limitations. And there was no digital jukebox or music store close to iTunes. With Apple Music, however, the company has had to invest heavily in marketing simply to try to catch up with Spotify and stay ahead of other potential rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Apple, thanks to its unimpeachably strong brand at home has become a strong rival to Spotify within the U.S. But it is getting killed in Europe and emerging markets where the iPhone lock-in effect isn't nearly as strong. Spotify has a huge brand advantage in many of these markets.In video, things look even worse. The Apple+ TV service is coming later this year. The company will spend heavily on original content to try to compete. But with Netflix already owning the space, and capable rivals like Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) leading the charge against Netflix, Apple will be another bit player that doesn't have enough going on to keep up with the leaders in video streaming. iTunes' End Shows Problems With AAPL StockNone of this suggests that Apple is a bad company or that AAPL stock is destined to flame out. But even the company's proponents must admit that the creative spark has largely been lost since Cook took over. The company has produced few truly innovative products or services in years. Apple continues to live off the largess it earns from the iPhone. That can potentially continue for quite a long while.But at some point, the company will need to come up with something new. The current services push is great for keeping revenues steady, but it is still reliant on owning the iPhone ecosystem. With the iTunes store, it had a great business model (capture a big portion of every sale with minimal overhead) that drew revenues from everyone, not just iPhone owners. Sadly, that easy cash flow is now lost to Spotify and Netflix as the iTunes era winds down.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Ironically, after several years of no news, Apple announced a brand new updated iPod. That may be great for some near-term profits, particularly if they can cash in on people's nostalgia. But this sort of &quot;innovation&quot; will do little for AAPL stock. They can't keep letting newcomers like Spotify and Netflix steal their established markets if they want to remain the world's leading consumer tech company.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2705,0.9977,"Generally speaking, &quot;buying on the dip&quot; is a smart strategy…and no stocks are more famously taking a dip lately than the &quot;FANG&quot; stocks: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). So let's take a look at what's going on beneath the surface.One factor that I always use to assess a stock is buying pressure. In other words: Is the stock experiencing positive momentum from big money on Wall Street rushing in? Or is this &quot;smart money&quot; rushing out?In the stock-rating system I developed at the beginning of my career -- and is responsible for my greatest buys over the years -- buying pressure is key. It is, essentially, what my proprietary Quantitative Score tells you. Here's a snapshot from my Portfolio Grader so you can see exactly how the FANG stocks measure up:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe talking heads on TV are still happy to shout all day long about these stocks - good or bad - as long as people continue to tune in. But, as you can see above, most of the FANG stocks have seen better days in terms of their buying pressure.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Fundamentals count, too -- they play a big role in a stock's rating, as they have a significant impact on its long-term success. And FB stock and GOOGL stock look particularly weak at this time.I am proud to have been an early bull on Google, just a few months after it IPOed, when its earnings growth caught my eye. But nowadays, well…GOOGL stock's Report Card tells a very different story:Still today, the sales growth is fairly strong. But earnings, not so much. With negative earnings surprises, subpar earnings growth and extremely poor earnings momentum - it's no wonder GOOGL stock is suffering downgrades from Wall Street analysts.FB stock is seeing a similar disconnect. Social media might run the world, but when it comes to your stocks, you've got to think not as a consumer, but as an investor. And Facebook's fundamentals simply aren't up to snuff at this time. Portfolio Grader tells the tale:If you go off of Facebook's sales growth, you might be tempted. But take a look at that earnings data. You can't forget the negative earnings surprises, (lack of) earnings growth and terrible earnings momentum when you're making your buying decision on FB stock. (That's even before you get to the weak operating margin growth and cash flow.)At times like this, it pays to do your homework on these stocks. The &quot;gurus&quot; on TV might be shouting down FANG stocks now, when they've plunged well off their highs. But soon they might be singing a very different tune. However, in the long run it never pays to buy into this hype.Ultimately, if I owe my own success to anything, it's my commitment to momentum and fundamentals -- not hopes and dreams. And Portfolio Grader will help you stay focused on what counts.At the end of the day, what you want is growth. And if you're looking for growth, you can't go wrong with highly rated growth stocks in big megatrends. That's where GOOGL stock was when I was among the first to recommend it, nearly 15 years ago. And I see similar opportunities today.I've got much more for you on my proven stock-picking system and what it's turning up today.

There has been little Microsoft news since MSFT reported its earnings in April, yet Microsoft stock has fallen 4% since the end of April.Source: Shutterstock The catalyst  appears to be recent broad market weakness. And the announcement of DOJ and FTC investigations into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) hasn't helped tech stocks, including MSFT stock.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Of course, Microsoft stock shouldn't be affected by the probes. The company already had its bruising battle with U.S. antitrust regulators. But that's kind of the point: with MSFT stock around $120-$130, It hasn't that taken much to knock Microsoft stock down. That in turn, suggests that it will take quite a bit for MSFT stock to rebound, and that it's going to be difficult for MSFT to move past its recent highs any time soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Trillion-Dollar Curse and MSFT StockMSFT stock gained nicely after its blowout fiscal third-quarter report in April. The jump following that strong Microsoft news moved the market capitalization of MSFT stock over the $1 trillion mark, making it the third company to reach that level.So far, reaching $1 trillion has proven to be a negative forward indicator. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first company to breach that level back in early August. AAPL stock would keep rising, but within two months it started a descent that wiped out one-third of its market value. AAPL now has a market cap closer to $850 billion.Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit the $1 trillion mark a month later. Its stay was much shorter, and it, too, would tumble amid the fourth-quarter market rout. An effort to retake the level this year failed, and the stock now is down 10% from the levels it reached after an earnings beat of its own. GOOGL stock has come close to $1 trillion twice, only to pull back sharply each time.This all may be coincidence. It's not really a surprise that the market's largest stocks soared when investors were optimistic and pulled back when they weren't. Round market-cap numbers, meanwhile, shouldn't mean anything in the context of detailed fundamental analysis.Still, it's at least possible that there's a psychological effect associated with the $1 trillion level. It's a valuation that sounds huge (and is huge), and it's a figure that suggests that pretty much everything should be going right for a company. And so, once a stock reaches the $1 trillion market-cap plateau, any signs of weakness might be amplified, and investors might be more willing to take profits. Microsoft News Since $130Whatever the cause, even before MSFT's recent weakness, investors seemed unwilling to pay more than $130 for MSFT stock,  a level that's almost exactly in-line with that $1 trillion market capitalization. But there are also fundamental reasons why that ceiling seemed to stay in place.It's true there's been little Microsoft news since its earnings,  but that's kind of the problem. Microsoft stock wasn't cheap at $130, as it was trading at something close to 25 times analysts' average 2020 EPS estimate after backing out its net cash. Solid earnings are helpful. But for MSFT stock to rally, Microsoft needs to report a blowout quarter, the kind that drives optimism for a long stretch and suggests a fundamental change in the company's growth trajectory.MSFT's Q3, as solid as it was, wasn't quite that good. This still is a company whose underlying earnings (before the impact of share repurchases) are growing slightly less than 10% annually. Even in a bull market, and even for a tech giant, it's tough to justify much more than a mid-20s P/E multiple with that type of growth.To be fair, Microsoft has rolled out a few new initiatives. Its partnerships with BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and insurer Willis Tower Watson (NYSE:WLTW) highlight the growing role of Microsoft's new technology. InvestorPlace columnist Luce Emerson has highlighted the company's new gaming offerings.None of those efforts will really move the needle, however, so investors are paying a mid-20s multiple on MSFT stock for 10% growth at most. As a result, MSFT's earnings multiples and Microsoft stock probably won't rise much.Between the trillion-dollar market cap problem and the high valuation, expecting more than $130 from MSFT seems optimistic.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

In lieu of agreement between the U.S. and its neighbor to the south, the tariff would gradually increase to 25% by October. That’s on top of continued tension with China.This continued global economic uncertainty sent investors looking for security in bonds. Short-term rates moved so low on Wednesday that the yield on 3-month bills T-bills was 14 basis points below 10-year notes, which is a level of inversion that hasn’t been experienced since the Financial Crisis. Bond investors are not always right, obviously, but an inverted yield curve is generally viewed as a signal that a recession could materialize in the next year or so. However not all is lost. There are still plenty of compelling investing opportunities out there. You just have to know where to look. Here we delve into the Street’s best-rating trending stocks right now. In other words, these are five of the stocks that have received the most buy ratings from analysts over the last seven days. View Trending Stocks detailSo what is driving this particularly bullish Street sentiment? Let’s take a closer look at these five top stocks:  1&#92;. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (BMRN – Research Report) BioMarin is buzzing right now. This pharma company has just received 11 back-to-back analyst buy ratings in just the last week. Analysts applauded a critical update from BioMarin’s Ph. I/II clinical study of valrox in patients with hemophilia A as well as initial data from the Ph. III study.Valrox is BioMarin’s gene therapy for hemophilia A, which management anticipates should receive regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2020. Working backwards, this would suggest an application submission in Q1’20. “We expect these data to support accelerated approval, and drive adoption” writes top-rated Cowen & Co analyst Phil Nadeau on May 28. He has a $150 price target on shares, indicating significant upside potential of 82%. “While valrox's launch trajectory remains uncertain, there is little question that Hem A is a large market and BioMarin estimates that overall there are 117K hemophilia A patients in its territories with 18K in North America alone” points out the analyst.This means that even modest penetration with a price point around $2MM would represent significant revenue, as ~$1B in sales could be achieved for every 500 adult patients treated. “Therefore valrox should soon become a growth driver for BioMarin” sums up Nadeau. See what other Top Analysts are saying about BMRN.  2&#92;. Dollar General Corp (DG – Research Report) Leading US discount retailer Dollar General has rallied 5% in the last five days, bringing its total year-to-date gain to an impressive 18%. The company has just reported stellar results for the first quarter with both comps and margins modestly above expectations. The result: eight consecutive buy ratings from the Street. “We remain buyers given our bullishness on DG’s defensive growth characteristics” writes RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli. “While mix and transportation costs continue to weigh on GMs and investments in initiatives like DG Fresh and Fast Track will pressure SG&A this year, these strategies (and several others) are helping drive solid sales growth” explains the analyst. While the year is clearly off to a good start, he believes management maintained guidance given the absorption of recent tariff increases, ongoing tariff uncertainty and 3/4 of the year still in front of us. Nonetheless, Ciccarelli still decides to boost his price target from $133 to $139 (9% upside potential). However, the highest price target comes from Buckingham Research’s Bob Summers. Post-earnings the analyst boosted his price target considerably, from $125 to $152 (19% upside potential) citing the ‘powerful combination’ of a strong quarter and beneficial macro backdrop for discount retailers.

And now it's crunch-time for the stock. On June 4, CRM will release its earnings results for the fiscal first quarter. Ahead of the print, analysts are optimistic about CRM’s outlook. Indeed five analysts have reiterated their buy ratings on the stock in the last week.Moness analyst Brian White sees prices spiking 29% to $195 in the coming months. He tells investors: “In a volatile market environment driven by growing trade tensions with China and now decisively spilling over into parts of the tech world, we believe SaaS vendors such as Salesforce remain attractive with a subscription-based model and strong secular cloud trends.” As for earnings, White is predicting strong 1Q:FY20 revenue forecast of $3.683 billion (up 23% YoY; Street is at $3.682 billion) and non-GAAP EPS estimate of $0.61 (Street is also at $0.61). Looking into 2Q:FY20, he is projecting sales of $3.921 billion with non-GAAP EPS rising to $0.69.A similarly bullish perspective comes from Piper Jaffray’s Alex Zukin: “We view CRM as the most attractive risk/reward in our coverage universe today.” Following positive checks with corporate tech buyers, he writes “Our checks suggest the company delivered results at or near internal plan” for the fiscal first-quarter. Plus CRM shares have dropped 8% in May- underperformed other software stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe. That makes now an appealing time to buy-in. As a result, Zukin reiterates his Salesforce buy rating and $180 price target (19% upside potential). See what other Top Analysts are saying about CRM.  4&#92;. Apple Inc (AAPL – Research Report) Trade tensions have wreaked havoc with Apple- sending prices plunging 13% in May. But that has done little to dent the Street’s enthusiasm for Apple stock. Indeed, in the last seven days, four analysts have reiterated their AAPL Buy ratings. One of these analysts is five-star Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth. “We reiterate our Strong Buy rating on AAPL as it continues to create value from its ecosystem with the launch of its key Services initiatives and view the recent U.S.-China trade-related weakness as a major buying opportunity” advises Feinseth. According to the analyst, AAPL’s Services business segment continues to emerge as one of the company’s future drivers of growth and profitability. That’s with new initiatives like a gaming platform, a credit card, a news service, and a video streaming service.These should provide more continuity to its ecosystem and further monetize the close to one billion iPhone user base, says Feinseth. He doesn’t offer a price target, but he does write: “We believe significant upside in the shares exists from current levels.” The stock is on both the firm’s Research Focus List and its Focus Opportunity Portfolio. Meanwhile Webush’s Daniel Ives delves further into the US-China impact on Apple. He has a buy rating on the stock with a $235 price target (34% upside potential). “We continue to strongly believe that for a company that employees over 1 million Chinese workers with its flagship Foxconn factory and is a major strategic player within the China technology ecosystem that from a supply chain perspective Apple will not have major roadblocks ahead despite the loud noise” writes the analyst. In fact, Ives believes the biggest risk comes from pro-China sentiment negatively impacting demand, but argues that this situation is currently contained at around 3% to 5% of Chinese iPhone sales. “Taking a step back, we ultimately believe there is a low likelihood that Apple and its iPhones feel the brunt of the tariffs given its strategic importance domestically as well as Cook’s ability to navigate these issues in the past” he concludes. See what other Top Analysts are saying about AAPL.  5&#92;. Marvell Technology Group (MRVL – Research Report) Shares in semiconductor manufacturing stock Marvell have exploded by 38% year-to-date. And now the company has just released its first quarter results. MRVL’s F1Q20 results were better than expected, but F2Q20 guidance was below expectations. The report reveals soft storage demand, although MRVL continues to expect a recovery in C2H20.However strong 5G momentum is keeping analysts and investors on-side. Most notably, MRVL announced two new 5G wireless base station design wins, which together are expected to increase MRVL's content per a base station by ~$500. As a result, six analysts have published buy ratings on Marvell in the last seven days, vs just 1 hold rating. “With two new 5G wireless base station design wins announced (first win generating rev in F4Q20) and a continued focus on high growth end markets with the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions and the divestiture of its WiFi business, we maintain our Buy and $28 PT” cheers Needham’s Quinn Bolton. From current levels that works out at 26% upside potential. Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann backs up Bolton’s estimates. He has just ramped up his price target from $24 to $28, explaining: “All in, we believe Marvell’s strategic positioning has improved at a much faster than expected rate and as a result, we are increasing our PT to $28 from $24.” See what other Top Analysts are saying about MRVL.",0.036,0.829,0.135,1

But Twitter stock could be a good way to avoid the current, overwhelming problem of market volatility.Source: Shutterstock That's a tough pill for some investors to digest. Against a backdrop of a brutal trade war and in an environment in which Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have somehow settled their legal spat even as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is actually asking for privacy regulation, clearly nothing is etched in stone.With all of its glorious, gimmick-free simplicity though, Twitter is the market's proverbial breath of fresh air that not too many traders are noticing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth  Off the RadarTwitter is not Facebook, a nuance that's been pointed out countless times since Twitter's launch in 2006. It's simplistic, lacking many of the vanity-minded features Facebook offers.TWTR is also less potent as an advertising platform. Twitter's average revenue per user is a little more than a third of Facebook's, and it has only a fraction of Facebook's regular user base. Twitter can't benefit from being big because it's not that large.As it turns out, however, perhaps Twitter's slightly less sophisticated i.e.  less invasive, approach of getting to know its users has been a blessing in disguise.That's not to suggest the company has remained completely free of controversy. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was rather well-grilled by a Senate committee late last year, and Twitter was investigated for potential violations of the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules shortly thereafter.But Senators' questions were focused more on censorship and less on privacy practices, and there's little doubt that the EU has been far more concerned with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) breadwinner Google and Facebook than it has been with Twitter.Google and Facebook make for much juicier targets, while Twitter is relatively benign, so Twitter stock doesn't face much of a regulatory headwind compared with other digital-ad stocks. Twitter Stock Price to Be Boosted by More Steady Growth AheadTwitter has sought to serve as an interactive, television-delivery platform, with an emphasis on sports programming. It partners with the NFL, but also works with ESPN . Last year, the platform also made it radically easier for users to find and engage in discussions that are of most interest to them.None of these platform improvements are exactly new though. They are tweaks that have been going on for years, so slowly that few observers have noticed.Long-term owners of Twitter stock have surely noticed, however, that the new M.O. not only works, but that Twitter has avoided the regulatory and media pressure that bigger players like Google and Facebook are enduring. As a result, TWTR has had a solid streak of revenue growth that's translating into similar earnings growth. Analysts expect more of the same for the foreseeable future.The  double-digit growth is sustainable simply because the company's business model isn't under attack the way Facebook's is. Indirect rival Google is also setting itself up for a step backwards, recently unveiling a way for users to delete a big chunk of their life that the tech giant regularly monitors. Ads shown to those users should, as a result, theoretically be less targeted, and therefore less effective.Twitter isn't being forced to take such disruptive actions. The Bottom Line on Twitter StockThough Twitter's top and bottom lines are more secure in this privacy-minded era than those of its competitors, it would be naive to think Twitter stock is equally well-shielded from volatility. Most stocks tend to ebb and flow with the tide of the stock market.For the right company though, bearish tides hurt a little less, and bullish tides help a little more.And, if the market's turbulence lasts long enough, raw financial results will eventually remind investors that TWTR stock is something of a standout, simply by virtue of sidestepping all the landmines too many other organizations have stepped on of late.Hopefully proving its mettle in this way won't be necessary, but given this week's market-wide trouble, that may be something the company is called on to do. Twitter stock price should pass that stability/predictability test with flying colors.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Alphabet.

2989,0.9969,"Two facts about the first quarter had some cloud mavens going &quot;hmmm?&quot; The first was the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quarter. Operating income from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud, rose more than 50% year-over-year, from $1.4 billion to $2.2 billion. Growth slowed but profitability rose sharply.Source: Shutterstock The second was a press release from Synergy Research, which follows the cloud or &quot;hyperscale data center&quot; market. It showed that capital spending by all cloud providers fell 2% from a year ago.Spending for the last four quarters, at $116 billion, is still 22% ahead of that for the previous four quarters. Synergy called this a &quot;breather.&quot; It blamed Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) $2.4 billion purchase of Manhattan real estate for causing a one-time &quot;blip&quot; in last year's numbers. Google's real estate purchases were lumped in with other capital spending.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTake that out and we're fine. Don't panic. A Mature MarketWhat the figures really show is that cloud is a mature market.The leaders in that market, what I call the &quot;Cloud Czars,&quot; are established. You know their names: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon, Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). China has its own version of the Czars, Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA), JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD), Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right Profits are now rolling in from this investment. Any slowdown in investment is money for the bottom line. The bottom line for the Czars is about to get fat.But companies that haven't achieved their cloud ambitions are only going to be handmaidens to the Czars. The door has slammed shut on International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), on AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). These companies can't overcome the Czars' market cap until computing changes again in some fundamental way. An Analyst's ViewJohn Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director of Synergy, says the basic cloud drivers haven't changed. The big profits are in leasing capacity. Cloud infrastructure revenues during the first half of 2019 were 42% higher than in the same period in 2018.The exception to the growth story is in mobile communications, Apple's business, where service provider revenues seem to have topped-out. Apple was the only one of the Czars that didn't increase capex at a double-digit rate during the quarter. Search-based advertising, e-commerce, social networking and software as a service remain strong markets.Growth may appear to slow this year because of the law of large numbers, which is that big numbers grow more slowly than small numbers. Synergy counts 458 cloud data centers around the world today, with over 140 more in various stages of planning or construction.&quot;Do we have enough cloud capacity? I don't think that we're even close. There are certainly more efficiencies that could be squeezed out of existing infrastructure, though the hyperscalers have a pretty good track record of running lean and mean,&quot; Dinsdale added. The Bottom Line on AMZNThe 2010's have been the &quot;decade of cloud.&quot; For the clouds, every week has been &quot;Infrastructure Week.&quot;  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Now the decade is ending.Clouds have transformed every industry, not just computing. Those companies that took the risk at the start of the decade, that seized the opportunity, created trillions of dollars of market cap for their investors.The 2020's will be different. Clouds are becoming application platforms for huge jobs in biology and fighting climate change. Clouds will also create new opportunities at the network edge, automating daily life, providing intelligence in what are inanimate objects today.&quot;We are not going to see the 2018 capex growth rates again. Ever,&quot; Dinsdale concluded. &quot;But the demand for ever-increasing hyperscale data center capacity is not going away.&quot;Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The Fed is now recommitted to being supportive of the stock market. They are no longer looking to raise rates systematically. Instead, they're more likely to cut rates so they can spur inflation. Oil prices are falling which further supports that theory that they cannot raise rates anytime soon.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth So some of the bad news that investors are fearing now is actually good news for the indices. Sentiment is fickle so I bet that while there is short term danger, it's an opportunity for the rest of the year. Why QQQ Stock?The Nasdaq is host to the most exciting companies on the planet. The largest is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and it's already cheap. Then there are the companies that make up the acronym FANG. The gang includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I would even add to it Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Those are massive companies that are doing almost everything right. Their fundamentals are as solid as they get. Apple sells at a 15x trailing price-to-earnings ratio. Most of the rest are around 30, which is still is reasonable given the amount of growth they deliver. The most expensive of them is Netflix, but that has always been the case.So today's write-up is to speculate that soon enough the Nasdaq will have a snap-back rally. The QQQ stock is this easiest way to capture the upside potential. The thesis is simple: There is just too much value in those behemoths below current levels.  And it will require incremental new bad news for prices to fall much further. Impact of the Tariff WarYes, we do have an ongoing tariff war and it is likely linger for a while, especially since a new front with Mexico may be opening soon. But the stock market has a way of pricing in risk ahead of time. Meaning if we already know about it, then most of the stock damage has already occurred.The bond market is acting like we are headed for a disaster. But for now, I see technical reasons why this bond rally should also end soon. Bond prices are headed toward a big ledge from which they fell November of 2016. This was a very important time, when President Trump took office. It took bond bulls over two years to get back to even, so odds are they take a break here for a bit. Long-term pivot zones like this are often sticky so they are resistance on the way up.So if the bond market rally abates here, it opens the door for stocks to find footing. Also the bond rally was so fast that it left a lot short-term froth below. So it can fall fast to retest the recent breakout neckline. This would then allow for an equities rally.The size of the QQQ rally should be at least 5% to 7% at first. There will be resistance at $180 and $182.50 per share. But then, if we get a few cooperating headlines -- especially from the geopolitical fronts -- then the Nasdaq bulls can breakout from $185.80 to target new all time highs. I know this sounds like I am a perma-bull here but the fundamentals are still great.I consider holding this trade through the end of the year. Meaning I am willing to withstand some heat as Wall Street comes to terms with the headlines. I'm not a fan of betting on ETFs, but the mega-cap companies that make up the bulk of the QQQ are of such great quality that I bet they will collectively rise for years to come. Short-term dips are opportunities to go long.So I can buy the QQQ stock itself or use options to profit from it. The advantage of holding the stock is that time is not as crucial as with options.The biggest obvious risk is from Apple. It has become the poster child for the tariff war threat. Speculation is that China will indeed retaliate using Apple as a weapon.Even if that happens and Apple falls closer to $170 per share, there is little froth to shed from there. Buyers will step in to provide support. AAPL's low P/E means that the math just doesn't allow for much lower prices.Furthermore and in spite of the geopolitical risk that still looms, the macroeconomic environment is still very healthy. We just saw a strong GDP report this week and favorable inflation reports. Yes, there are sectors in trouble -- retail for example, which is reeling from horrendous earnings reports. Most of them had ample time to find workarounds for the tariff obstacles but they dragged their feet.The bottom line is that the current level of fear in the headlines has exceeded its reality. This is more to do with fear mongering than realistic downside potential, especially in the top six companies that make up the QQQ stock. So regardless of the headlines, the math provides a good base for rallies.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

3022,-0.6245,"Stocks eked out a gain on Thursday, but it didn't feel like a victory for the bulls. &quot;Gut&quot; can only take you so far, but it feels like this market wants to go lower before it goes higher. Maybe that won't be the case and the tricky part is, one tweet from one person can change everything. Let's look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Dollar General  Click to EnlargeWe heard from the dollar stores on Thursday, leading off with Dollar General (NYSE:DG). Shares are up 7% after beating earnings, but are running into possible resistance near $126.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf prior resistance holds up, investors will want to see the 20-day and 50-day moving averages hold as support, even though that would discouragingly mean DG gives up most of its post-earnings gains. Below that is uptrend support currently near $119 and level support near $116.50.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War If resistance fails and DG goes higher, look to see it push up to channel resistance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Dollar Tree  Click to EnlargeDollar Tree (NYSE:DLTR) also reported earnings and while shares jumped 3% on poor guidance (which is great!), the overall action is discouraging in my view. At least so far. Remember when we formulated a trade in DLTR around $100? Shares ran to almost $112 in very orderly fashion.However, it's since fallen apart. Now what?A rally above $100 was rejected on Thursday, so until it can clear this level, it's a no-touch for me. Ideally though, it will also clear short-term downtrend resistance (blue line) and the 20-day moving average.Below Thursday's low opens up a possible test of the 200-day. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Apple  Click to EnlargeApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a dud lately, as investors worry about demand and tariff implications from the trade war. It tried to break out of a falling wedge pattern on Thursday, but failed to do so.Take careful note though, because the stock is sitting right above its 61.8% retracement at $175.20. A break below almost guarantees a test of $168 to $170 and possibly lower. A break over short-term resistance can run Apple back to the 200-day moving average. That is, assuming its 20-day doesn't act as resistance first. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Veeva Systems  Click to EnlargeLooking for a stud in a tough tape? How about Veeva Systems (NASDAQ:VEEV) after delivering a knockout quarter. VEEV hit its highest volume of the year on Thursday's 14% rally to new highs.Shares aren't overbought yet and momentum just turned in bulls' favor. Wow, that's saying a lot, isn't it?VEEV gave investors a little fakeout on Wednesday ahead of earnings, breaking below the 50-day before gapping higher on Thursday. It's now hitting channel resistance. VEEV has so much going for it on the chart, and that makes me think that maybe it can push through this trend.But if the overall market comes under pressure, VEEV stock may have no choice but to come down too. Follow the trends that have been in place so far this year. Above uptrend resistance and it's possible it can become a new floor of support for Veeva. Otherwise, prior trend is in play as support. A break of Wednesday's lows would signal big trouble, but that's a long ways off. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Amarin  Click to EnlargeAmarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) stock is coming off Wednesday's big rally, which gives investors a shot on the long side if they're so inclined.I wanted to look at this one yesterday, but thought I should give it one more day to see how it responds to Wednesday's big gain. I'm glad I did, because shares are down over 4% Thursday. As long as it holds up over prior downtrend resistance (blue line), AMRN is okay on the long side.  * Ranking the Top 10 Stock Buybacks of Last Year It couldn't hold the 50-day, which would have been preferred, but over $17 and it's still okay. I would like AMRN on a slightly deeper dip, say down to $17.50 for a better risk/reward.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday.Pay London: A new feature is likely coming to Apple Pay users in London, reports MacRumors. According to this rumor, the tech company is working on a Pay Express Transit feature. This would allow users of Pay to use the service when paying for their fare. The feature would reportedly work without the need to unlock the device. This would make it quicker for users to move through lines and get to their trains. The rumors says that this feature will release in the next few months.Music App: New details suggest that support for Apple Music is coming to more devices in Canada, AppleInsider notes. The rumor says that the company will be releasing the app for Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) line of Echo smartspeakers in the country. It also says that support will come for Fire devices in Canada as well.

3054,0.1861,"When Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced recently it had won a favorable settlement from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its long-running legal battle, QCOM stock analysts breathed a sigh of relief and told their customers to buy, buy, buy.Source: Shutterstock In the aftermath, Qualcomm stock shot up. By the morning of May 21, it seemed clear skies were ahead. But Apple's lawsuit had a point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh ruled on May 21 that Qualcomm's policy of forcing the industry to license patents on its terms in order to make communications chips violated the Federal Trade Commission Act.Suddenly all those optimistic projections for QCOM stock are open to question. Political PushbackQualcomm continues to defend its &quot;no license, no chips&quot; business model, which requires companies to license its patents in order to make, or buy, modem hardware, piling on patents to make those rights eternal, and keeping companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the communications business.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Apple's complaint was that Qualcomm charged it retail prices for wholesale orders. The FTC's complaint, lodged in the dying days of the Obama Administration, was that Qualcomm was refusing to license its patents to competitors under what are called Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) standards.On the merits, the FTC is right. That's precisely Qualcomm's business model. Before beating Apple in court, Qualcomm had forced South Korean and Chinese regulators to back down on the point, in exchange for fines.These governments acceded to the monopolist's demands because they needed the tech. But it was still an illegal monopoly. Working the RefsLike AT&T (NYSE:T), which goes from courts to states to federal regulators and back to courts in order to get its way, Qualcomm reacted to the decision politically.Stunned Qualcomm analysts called the ruling a &quot;gift&quot; to China, specifically Huawei, which the Trump Administration is fighting. The American Enterprise Institute called the Justice Department's action supporting the FTC &quot;unprecedented&quot;  (it's not).  The Wall Street Journal called it a &quot;coup,&quot;  claiming a decision ending a monopoly kneecaps &quot;competition.&quot; Legally, the Qualcomm position is simply unsustainable.But Qualcomm isn't concerned with the legal niceties. Qualcomm plays hardball and has even won decisions upholding its monopoly in China. This is practically a home game.In terms of technology the Trump Administration policy has been &quot;random&quot; and &quot;all over the place,&quot; according to Reuters. A policy without principles is bad for business, Reuters adds. They're right. Kleptocracy only benefits kleptomaniacs.Even if the Trump Administration supports Qualcomm's appeal, it could face a long legal road. But the Trump Administration has intervened directly on Qualcomm's behalf before. It killed an attempt by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to buy it in 2017, claiming national security concerns, even after Broadcom moved its headquarters from Singapore to San Jose.If enough of the President's friends scream at him long enough, he could make a similar decree here, law be damned. The Bottom Line for QCOM StockThe Koh decision doesn't end the matter. It just makes the future of QCOM stock as uncertain as it was before the Apple settlement. And investors agree; QCOM is down 15% since the ruling.If the company is required to renegotiate its license agreements it would be &quot;onerous,&quot; as critics maintain. QCOM stock's recent rise was based on the idea that if Apple can't beat it, and China can't beat it, Qualcomm's illegal monopoly must not be illegal.But it is.Patent rights are always limited, both in terms of time and the conditions under which they're licensed. Qualcomm is a monopolist. Politicians may believe that opening the market to competition benefits China more than the U.S., but the principle in this case seems clear.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War Monopoly rents are monopoly rents, even if a political friend is collecting them.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

After the recent pullback in May, AAPL stock is trading at just 15 times its earnings.Source: Shutterstock Many consider Apple to be a consumer stock as opposed to a technology stock, but even with the company's pivot toward services, it's still operating in the tech world. Its main product in hardware is a smartphone (it also makes smartwatches) and its streaming and television service offerings primarily utilize digital technology.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War However, even if we call Apple a consumer company, it's difficult to understand why AAPL stock is trading on par with very traditional consumer cyclical stocks like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI have been skeptical about Apple before, but valuation changes things. After the decline of AAPL stock price, investors can own shares of  a great company for a reasonable price. Investing Alongside the BestPurchasing great companies at fair prices has been an investing philosophy that has worked quite well for legendary investor Warren Buffett. He is Apple's second-largest shareholder through his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).In an interview in late February, Buffett said that, &quot;If it [AAPL stock] were cheaper, we'd be buying it. We aren't buying it here.&quot;Apple stock price is now getting close to the mid-$170 range, where AAPL stock was trading in February. It's worth keeping an eye on AAPL stock to see if the shares slide further. If they do, it could be a great buying opportunity for investors.Because of the valuation of Apple stock, AAPL stock does seem to be a value-type name.  But there is good reason to believe that, while AAPL won't match the growth stats of the Jobs era, there are a few catalysts that could rev up Apple's numbers in the coming quarters. Apple Shifts to ServicesAfter Apple's quarterly revenue declined 5% last quarter, Apple is determined to reverse that trend by focusing on its Services business.Apple's Services revenue has already hit all-time highs.  And in the wake of the release of new products like Apple News+ and Apple TV+, there are new levers for Apple to pull.That said, Apple isn't completely giving up its bread and butter. It's finding new ways to better monetize its existing products,  helping to lift its top line. Juicier growth numbers may be coming from the Services business, but there is still money to be made in hardware.For example, after four years, Apple finally redesigned and repriced the iPod Touch. iPod Touch prices start at $199 (compared to $329 for the basic iPad). It's a great starter product that gets consumers hooked on AAPL's  new services. That may not get investors excited, but it demonstrates the positive incremental changes the company is making. A lot of little revenue boosters like that could end up making a big impact on Apple's profits. The Bottom Line on AAPL StockTim Cook's legacy is on the line. This is the year that Apple stock price either stalls or breaks higher. In the next couple of quarters, investors will see just how much the new services are contributing and how much traction they are gaining with customers. Apple TV+ , which rolls out in the fall,  could help reinvigorate AAPL stock.The fact is that Apple still has an incredible brand, and there is reason to believe that some of the worst is behind the company. Mispricing missteps have been corrected and AAPL is adopting new measure that should boost its growth. China could still be a stumbling point for AAPL, but at its current valuations, Apple stock probably prices in fallout from the Trade War.Trading at 15 times earnings with a number of new products in the pipeline, AAPL stock looks attractive.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3058,-0.9914,"Fintech darling Square (NYSE:SQ) continued its roller coaster performance this week, closing down almost 4% on Wednesday. Square stock had seen significant growth to start 2019 but that changed to a downward trend after the company reported Q1 earnings on May 1. Since then, Square stock stock performance has been all over the map, but the trend has been downward.Source: Via SquareYesterday's drop means SQ is down 14% since the start of the month. The big questions are, why is Square sliding and why the recent volatility?  SQ Stock Trouble? Not China and Not PrivacyOne thing Square has going for it is a lack of exposure to two of the biggest issues that have been wreaking havoc with tech stocks over the past year: the trade war with China and privacy concerns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompanies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have seen their stock repeatedly hit by an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, that has resulted in tariffs and the threat of boycotts. Square's mobile payment processing is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom -- not China.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War The one area where SQ stock could have a minor exposure is its hardware. Square designs its own hardware, but does have manufacturing partners outside the U.S., and high-tech products like the Square Terminal and Square Reader may utilize components that are affected. In Q1, the company reported hardware revenue of $18 million, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to its $959 million in total net revenue.Square CEO Jack Dorsey's other gig -- Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) -- along with other tech giants has seen its stock hit by ongoing investigations over privacy, fake information, and election interference. Square is in the clear on this front. Square's Q1 Earnings Failed to ImpressThings got rough for Square stock when the company reported its Q1 earnings on May 1, resulting in a 6% drop for SQ. While total net revenue was up 43% year-over-year with an adjusted EPS of 11 cents, Square's losses widened to $38 million (from $24 million in Q1 2018). A big part of that was operating expenses of $419 million, which were up 52% compared to Q1 2018. What had many investors concerned was gross payment volume of $22.6 billion, which grew 27% on the year, but missed analyst expectations by $200 million. Square's growth is showing signs of slowing … Worse, Square issued Q2 guidance for EPS of between 14 cents and 16 cents per share, again lower than analysts had been expecting. Increasing Competition for Square StockSquare faces increasing competition in virtually all areas of its business, and that has contributed to the turbulence in Square stock. PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo competes directly with Square's Cash app for consumers, and Venmo posted payment volume growth of 73% year-over-year in Q1, on volume of $21 billion. Other companies have taken note of Square's success in point-of-sale and have launched their own competing services. For example, a month ago Canadian fintech Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) took aim at Square with a move from web sales to introducing a new line of retail hardware, including a card reader and a point of sale tablet.As InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek points out, Square has a valuation that is much higher than other companies focused on payment technology. Unlike other tech companies, a trade war with China and the prospect of fines and regulation over user data is not an issue for SQ. But combine that high valuation with slowing payment volume growth, disappointing earnings guidance, increased competition and inevitable takeover talk, and you get the perfect recipe for Square stock volatility, and an overall downward trend.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3063,0.9912,"So far, 2019 has been much better than the end of 2018. Except that this week, equity markets are starting to feel like the markets of last December. But what's at the heart of my bullish thesis on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) today is that this time it's different!Source: Shutterstock This market swoon is not like the one from last year because this time we have the U.S. Federal Reserve as a friend, not a foe. Last year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made the mistake of saying that their interest rate hike cycle was on cruise control. Since then, they have reversed course. Now they are more likely to cut rates than raise them.At the heart of yesterday's dip is the notion that the yield curve is inverting. This is something that the Federal Reserve can remedy. So the fears here are not realistic, and good stocks like Microsoft have upside still left in them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How to Trade MSFT StockWhen my overall thesis is bullish but the markets are falling, I build a shopping list of good stocks to buy. MSFT makes the cut almost every time, and here it's no different. It it important to note that we are still pretty close to all-time highs in the market, and in Microsoft stock some more downside is possible but the bottom is limited.So my overall assumption is that these headlines are more about media trying to drum up readership than actual concerns over the fundamentals. This too shall pass and we will resume higher to set new highs this year.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War MSFT stock is a stock that I would gladly hold for the long term. Microsoft management has proven itself worthy. They've survived through every test including the dot-com bubble. So this skirmish here is not going to be different.Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, they are making all the right moves. They finally steered the ship into the new tech world of subscription revenue. They ended the old ways of standalone version selling that was riddled with piracy. So now the profit and loss statement is more consistent so they can build on future technologies to come.For the short term, the media will continue to push inflammatory headlines down Wall Street's throat and influence unnecessary price gyrations from the fears they create. So there are important lines to know.In March, MSFT stock made a leap higher from the $115 per share zone, so that becomes the neckline to watch for support in case the selling persists here. But there is a lot of room between current levels and that pivot point.The stock also has an important interim area around $2.50 above or below $120 per share. These served as mini-ledges that should also be support on the way down. The bulls will test them for footing before using them as a launch pad for higher highs.The action above $122.50 has been volatile. The bulls spiked to new highs on the earnings report twice, but both times they faded the moves and are now back at the same base.So if the markets in general stop falling here, then the odds are that MSFT stock will push higher again. This time it could burst to new highs. Conversely, if the selling lingers longer, then Microsoft is vulnerable at this neckline. Below $122.50, it could target the prior levels we noted earlier.So from a trading perspective, we all know that they don't ring bells for perfect entry points into stocks. So while we are still in danger of geopolitical headline mode, we can be cautious and start setting up entries into names like Microsoft stock.Those who are interested in owning the shares for the long term there is no sense of trying be surgical here. For those more active traders they can nibble with a starter position or use the options markets.Instead of buying the shares, those who want to own shares can sell the Oct $105 put and collect $1.75 per contract. I don't even need a rally to win. As long as the price stays above $105 then I win. Otherwise I own the shares and lose money below $103.25 per share. Compare this with being long Microsoft stock from right here with no buffer.Calling for new highs at these altitudes -- up 23% year to date -- sounds gluttonous, but in reality MSFT valuation is reasonable. It sells at a 28 trailing price to earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months. So this is based on actual results not speculation. This is also in line with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). MSFT is not a momo stock like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) or Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which have a 107 and 51 trailing P/E's respectively.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Whether buying goods from China or trying to sell products to China, navigating this trade war is a real difficulty.Source: Shutterstock Meanwhile, investors of all stripes are trying to figure out how to best insulate their portfolios from what's quickly becoming a global economic contagion.Is it even possible to hide from this trade war in which no one wins? Probably not. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, I've got three ideas for minimizing your exposure.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June  Buy Service-Oriented StocksThe argument for buying service-oriented stocks, especially those focused on the domestic market, is that they have far less exposure to trade policy. Naturally, most people immediately think of smaller companies, but that doesn't have to be the case. Sectors that come to mind include healthcare, utilities, software, real estate, etc. For example, although Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ecommerce business would be affected by the trade war, its AWS segment, which generated $2.2 billion of operating income in the quarter ended March 31 from $7.7 billion in revenue, wouldn't face nearly the same tariff concerns. In Q1 2019, its North American operating segment generated about the same amount of operating income from almost five times as much revenue. Although Amazon's doing a lot more third-party selling these days, whether its Amazon or the third party that owns the product, the trade war isn't helping their businesses. So, Amazon's a good, if not great way to minimize the trade war headwinds. Another possibility is to buy healthcare businesses that have a strong services component like hospital operators, healthcare plan providers, retirement and assisted living facilities, etc. In mid-April, I suggested that those who had the stomach start buying UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock despite the calls for &quot;Medicare for All&quot; because whatever the future holds for the provider of healthcare benefits and services, its stock has got to be worth more than $220. UNH stock bottomed in mid-April and has rebounded by more than 10% in the six weeks since. With the trade war hanging over our heads, a stock like UNH wouldn't be half bad. Alternatively, if you don't want to go the stock selection route, a good option would be to buy iShares Healthcare  Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF), a collection of stocks targeting domestic healthcare services companies like UnitedHealth, which is the ETFs number one holding with a weighting of 22.94%.   Boring but ConsistentWith an ongoing trade war possibly leading to a recession, the best stocks to buy in this situation might be the most boring. Stocks that deliver consistent dividends or distributions and aren't necessarily affected by what's happening on the trade front. Two sectors that meet these criteria are real estate and utilities. Real estate, especially if you're investing in multi-family residential, is an area that's not going to suffer nearly as much from a downturn because we all have to live somewhere. Utilities benefit from the same scenario; we all need to pay our bills if we want to keep the lights on and the home appliances and electronics running smoothly. That's why Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budgeting rule, which puts aside 50% of your after-tax income for bills that you absolutely must pay. Rather than pick the real estate or utilities stocks to own, it would be much easier to buy two inexpensive ETFs to meet your needs. I'd go with iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:REZ) for the real estate play. Approximately 49% of its net assets are invested in residential REITs with the remainder in REITs that own retirement homes, storage facilities and other specialized real estate assets. It charges 0.48% annually.  As for utilities, I'd go with Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU). It's inexpensive at 0.10% and only has 68 holdings with its top ten accounting for 53% of the ETFs $4.8 billion in total net assets.    Park Your Money If you're freaked out by the consequences of a lingering trade war, you can always move your portfolio out of equities and into a certificate of deposit or high-yield savings account until the skirmish is settled.  Or, you can buy into the MNA IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (NYSEARCA:MNA), an expensive ETF at 0.78% annually that's worth every penny. I first suggested the ETF in September 2017.  Utilizing a directional hedge fund strategy, it has very little correlation to either the equity or fixed income markets, making it the perfect fund to own when both types of securities are losing their value. It's not going to make you rich, but in my opinion, it will protect your downside better than most bond funds would. Alternatively, you could invest in one of the many special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) currently listed, preferably one that's gone public in the last 3-6 months. That's because SPAC's are blind pools of money raised to use for an acquisition at some point in the 21 months after an IPO. The funds are placed in escrow and interest is paid until a target company is found to acquire. If a target's not found, the funds are returned to investors with interest.   It's an excellent way to park your funds with minimal downside and potential upside should an acquisition come to pass before the 21-month deadline. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3073,0.9894,"Just when it looked like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) had put all of its legal woes in the rearview mirror, a new batch of them land in the company's lap, taking a significant toll on QCOM stock.Since last week's high, Qualcomm stock has fallen more than 17% on the heels of news that the FTC has successfully convinced a U.S. District Court that the company's royalty rates for use of its patented technologies are unfairly high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe matter is still up for debate; Qualcomm says it intends to appeal the recent ruling from Judge Lucy Koh. Success or failure on that front may be irrelevant, however. It's now clear that no matter what, the company will be dealing with legal headaches as long as it continues to work its current business model, using its current set of patents.The alternative? Simply accepting lower margins, though rolling over could prove amazingly unpopular with Qualcomm stock owners. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh believes the recent ruling prompted by the FTC's efforts could cut the company's profits in half, if the judge's decision holds up in appellate court.Take a closer look at some of the recent headlines though. Qualcomm has already been working on its proverbial &quot;plan B.&quot; It shows promise as a replacement for jeopardized high-margin revenue. Up-EndedA month ago, all seemed well. The company had just settled years-long legal wrangling with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and then went on to disclose that its third-quarter revenue from the iPhone maker would be far greater than most anyone anticipated. Qualcomm was also coming out as a 5G player on the verge of sweeping commercialization of 5G connectivity.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer Then the Huawei ban. Then the recent ruling from a California courtroom, which led Koh to order a renegotiation of patent licensing deals at &quot;fair and reasonable prices.&quot; The judge also made clear that exclusive deals -- like the one it had made with Apple -- were off-limits.The decision clearly takes dead aim at Qualcomm's bread and butter, given the tumble QCOM stock has seen since the latest chapter of a storied saga.The company has actually been developing and even launching new products though, which may relieve some of the brewing pressure on its margins. New ProductsWhile the pace of adoption of virtual reality and augmented reality tech has been much slower than expected, the need is still there; the technology was ready before the marketplace could handle it.To that end, Qualcomm just unveiled its Smart Viewer Reference Design, built on the Qualcomm(r) Snapdragon XR1 Platform. The technology could serve as the basis for next-generation AR and VR hardware, and deliver performance that could answer the &quot;what do we do with it?&quot; question that has so far bogged down the movement.More compelling than that, though, is the recently unveiled laptop built with on-board 5G (wireless) connection hardware. Co-developed with Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), the device offers at-home broadband speeds wherever it goes… mobile like a smartphone, but all the computing power (and keyboard) of an actual PC.At first glance it's a solution to a problem that doesn't seem to exist. A second, closer look at the solution may suggest complete broadband mobility at 4G speeds wasn't worth the time, effort or expense. The device may mark the onset of a whole new standard in laptop development.More than that, it's a not-so-subtle reminder that 5G is mostly going to be supplied and powered by Qualcomm, more so with the tech you don't see than the tech you do.Bolstering this argument is the fact that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is abdicating its wireless broadband modem business altogether, further clearing a path for Qualcomm. Unusual SituationArguably the biggest upside for Qualcomm and QCOM stock in the midst of the madness, however, is the unique position the U.S.-China trade war's ultimately put the tech maker in.What it might look like remains unclear, but if Bloomberg's Shira Ovide is right, Washington may somehow bail Qualcomm out of any trouble it may find itself in going forward.Susquehanna Investment Group analyst Christopher Rolland's &quot;reasoning is that Qualcomm is the U.S.' 'great 5G hope,' explains Ovide, who goes on to say &quot;Qualcomm is one of the few American companies that is essential in guiding standards for next-generation mobile internet technology. This has become as much a symbol of nationalist self-interest as it is a technical project. The U.S. government has framed 5G as a race between the U.S. and China, and Qualcomm is running for flag and country.&quot;  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Remember, it was the U.S. government that ultimately ran interference for Qualcomm last year when Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) attempted a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, citing the importance of its 5G know-how.Futurum Research's Daniel Newman says the same. Bottom Line for QCOM StockNone of the products or unspoken governmental support will alter the inevitable reality Qualcomm has been postponing for years. That is, its business model has more than pushed the envelope of what constitutes overly restrictive practices. Even if successful with its appeal (which is statistically unlikely), the company has managed to make multiple enemies … even if they appear to be partners on the surface.It's overly pessimistic to fear Qualcomm can't or won't overcome this headwind, though. As Futurum's Newman added to his bullish case, &quot;Qualcomm intellectual property is still the best. Apple settled on the merits of its agreement with Qualcomm, knowing full well that this ruling would have helped its case. It knew no other company could support its ambitions in 5G and mobile technology.&quot;There's also the mostly overlooked possibility that the more affordable (and less exclusive) Qualcomm's IP becomes, the more customers it may attract.In that light -- and given that shares had already moved to a price above $90 earlier this month -- the consensus target of $96.59 still doesn't seem unreasonable. One just has to be willing to take a step back and look at the bigger picture to realize the recent drop was sparked more investors looking through an overwhelmingly pessimistic lens.An end to the ban on doing business with Huawei could end up being a rebound catalyst.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3095,-0.8424,"Concerns over the deepening rift with China is pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average back to levels not seen since early February, a clear breakdown below its 200-day moving average. What is worrying is that the move traces out a head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a decline to the 24,000 level last seen in February, which would be worth a loss of roughly 5% from here.There's a lot to worry about these days, from Beijing's threat of a rare-earth metals export ban to the risk higher tariffs present to the global supply chain network.No wonder then that the bond market is sending its strongest recession warnings since 2007, with much of the U.S. Treasury yield curve &quot;inverting&quot; as long-term rates fall below short-term rates -- a sign that something is very wrong with the global economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever As a result, a number of mega-cap stocks are breaking lower. Here are four Dow Jones stocks under huge pressure. Disney (DIS)  Click to EnlargeDespite the very hyped opening of the new Star Wars Galaxy's Edge themed area in the Disneyland theme park, shares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) are preparing to drop out of a two-month consolidation range with a likely return to the lows seen in early April, which would be worth a fall of nearly 11% from here.The company will next report results on Aug. 7 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.77 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on May 8, earnings of $1.61 beat estimates by 4 cents on a 2.6% rise in revenues. Nike (NKE)  Click to EnlargeNike (NYSE:NKE) shares are cutting down below their 200-day moving average, falling below the $80-a-share level for the first time since January and breaking into downtrend territory for the first time since December. The company is at the center of tariff concerns, with a group of shoe companies recently asking Trump not to raise import duties on footwear.  * 7 Stocks to Sell After Earnings Destroyed Their Long-Term Stories The company will next report results on June 20 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 67 cents per share on revenues of $10.2 billion. When the company last reported on March 21, earnings of 68 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents on a 7% rise in revenues. Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's most important technology company, is returning to levels seen in early March as analysts worry the deepening trade war will have a direct impact on its bottom line.

3098,0.8601,"This time it's different. We've all heard this phrase before, often in a condescending context. Typically, market forecasters who got something wrong earlier will use it to double down on their initial prognostication. But when it comes to picking which stocks to sell amid the re-escalated U.S.-China trade war, this situation has no parallel.Obviously, the biggest wildcard in this economic conflict is U.S. President Donald Trump. Right when circumstances appeared favorable for a trade resolution, the former real-estate mogul had other ideas. In a social media post, he blasted the Chinese for dragging their feet toward the negotiating table. Naturally, the about-face angered China, scuttling scheduled talks and by logical extension, boosting the bearish case for stocks to sell.But the other critical factor in this dispute is the Chinese response. They no longer appear amused to play the typical diplomatic courtesies. Their rhetoric has taken on a much more nationalistic sentiment. For example, China's officials referenced deep historical overtones to slight the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Plus, Trump's counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping, used the term &quot;long march&quot; regarding the trade war. That's referring to China's civil war and the ultimate rise of the communist party. Although I'm sure nuances exist, that aggressive tone highlights the importance of recognizing which stocks to sell.Finally, I wouldn't get complacent about this trade war. Although agriculture and technology represent the front-facing victims, everyone suffers when the top two economies collide. With that, here are seven stocks to sell amid the second round of the trade war: Stocks to Sell: Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock This might seem like an easy one, plucking the lowest of low-hanging fruit. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seeking new avenues to diversify its business, China offered a viable safety valve. But with heightened tensions, AAPL stock has noticeably suffered. Since the first of May, shares have dropped nearly 15%.That volatility might cue contrarians to enter the markets. But if you're among them, I'd continue to hold off. Sure, AAPL stock remains a robust investment. It wasn't too long ago that the underlying consumer-tech firm became the world's first trillion-dollar company. However, its search for revenue diversification just took a huge hit with re-intensified tensions.Like other portable-device manufacturers, Apple must contend with &quot;peak smartphone.&quot; To get around this growing problem, AAPL sought to build out its Services division. But legal challenges now cloud that business.Therefore, you should play the safe game here and put AAPL on your list of stocks to sell. Under Armour (UA, UAA)Source: Shutterstock For quite some time, I've urged readers to put Under Armour (NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) in their basket of stocks to sell. One of the reasons I didn't believe in Under Armour stock is the irrational market toward sports sponsorships. The bottom line here is that the broader athletic machinery is paying ridiculous sums of money to adults to play a kid's game.Still, that's the nature of the beast: if you want to play, you have to pay. However, UA stock, when stacked up against sector leaders Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) fares poorly on a financial scale. To win against these titans, Under Armour must hope for a lucky break.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Oh, there's breaking going on, but not the good kind. We all know from Foot Locker's (NYSE:FL) dreadful miss in their first-quarter earnings report that the U.S. consumer is hurting. To make ground, Under Armour needs a robust Chinese market. Here, geopolitical tensions threaten to derail everything for UAA stock. Walmart (WMT)Source: Shutterstock Now we're going to talk about one of the stocks to sell that hurts me. I like retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Actually, let me clarify: I don't like shopping there, but I recognize their investment strength. WMT stock represents a brick-and-mortar retail powerhouse that has proven immune to e-commerce disruption. It also pays a dividend, which usually protects shares from volatility.But let's face facts here. Favorable financial metrics supported Walmart during the first round of the trade war. But that situation was only a temporary reprieve. Last September, Walmart's management team urged the Trump administration to ease diplomatic tensions. At some point, tariffs will force retailers to take drastic measures, including consumer-price hikes.That's hugely problematic because of Walmart's shoppers. These are consumers that cannot absorb a price hike, which is why I'm cautious on WMT stock now. General Motors (GM)Source: Shutterstock Amid these escalating tensions, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has two reasons why its equity belongs on a list of stocks to sell. Number one, American cars are junk. Number two, the marketing machinery to sell American cars is equally disappointing. Detroit loves to pander to patriotism and subtle anti-Japanese sentiment to generate sales.You know what's more patriotic? Taking pride in your work and rising up to meet a challenge.Anyways, GM stock does have an ace up its sleeve -- or should I say, did. In America, GM brands like Buick have all but died in terms of relevancy. But in China, that's different. Due to longstanding historical and cultural reasons, the Chinese love American cars.That will likely change, though, with this heated conflict. You see, GM stock is levered two ways with China: General Motors sell to the Chinese, and they also contract the Chinese to sell GM-branded cars to us. That's why management was so desperate to seek an exemption from the Trump administration last year.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer But with how things are going geopolitically, you can kiss GM stock goodbye. Tiffany (TIF)Source: Shutterstock Earlier this year, Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) seemed like a sound investment among the rather shaky discretionary-spending segment. Although the company's overall revenue went flat for the holidays, it did have a bright spot: sales growth in mainland China, which jumped by double digits in the last two months of 2018. It's a formula that many distinguished organizations have failed to master, separating TIF stock from the competition.But now, the trade war urges stakeholders to toss it into their portfolio of stocks to sell. The pivotal reason is that Beijing is determined to play the long game against Washington. This is the reason why the Chinese government's aforementioned aggressive rhetoric is so worrying: they mean it.Unlike the U.S. and most western countries, China is largely racially and ethnically homogenous. When most of its citizens are Han Chinese, you have fewer opportunities for internal strife. Therefore, it's easier for Beijing to appeal to nationalistic sentiment. Demographically, everyone is on the same page.And let's be real: boycotting frivolities like jewelry is easy. Thus, I'd steer clear of TIF stock for now. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Shutterstock I've mostly focused on American companies for my list of stocks to sell. But that doesn't mean I'm letting Chinese stocks off the hook. The knife cuts both ways. As such, most publicly traded Chinese firms are suspect. However, I'll sum up my reservations for the region by addressing Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), China's flagship corporate entity.China is a country built on intellectual theft. China's scientific infrastructure is based on possibly record-breaking fraud and intellectual theft. According to Business Insider, &quot;a mind-blowing number of counterfeit goods come from China.&quot; Even their art industry is buoyed by a shocking level of corruption!So is it any surprise that for years, analysts questioned BABA stock?  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend While I'm concerned about the coming pain stateside, the Chinese better watch out for their own good. Angering Trump only makes him want to double, triple, heck even quadruple down on his initial policy. Eventually, BABA stock can take a long march out of the markets if the Chinese overplay their hand. NIO (NIO)Source: Shutterstock Please forgive me for my thoughts on GM if you drive or love American cars. I'm just telling it like it is. But if you still have some bitter lingering emotions, allow me to soothe them with my take on NIO (NYSE:NIO). Among automotive stocks to sell, this one takes the cake.NIO stock faces so many problems it's difficult to know where to start. Primarily, I'd say that it's incredibly difficult to break into the automotive market. For example, it took Toyota (NYSE:TM) decades of long-term strategizing to break into and later dominate the U.S. market.That segues into my second point, which is that NIO has zero chance of breaking into the U.S. market with this trade war. Seriously, Japanese automakers have invested billions into American jobs and infrastructures, yet Trump still cries foul. If that's the stance the administration takes on allies, imagine being an adversary?Finally, NIO has a credibility problem. Chinese manufacturing has a poor reputation that really hasn't improved much today. If Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) can't build a car that's consistently reliable, can Nio do better?I thought not, which is why I'm steering clear of NIO stock despite its discount.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

If they rise, we fall, and vice versa.This is the biggest lie of all. What the U.S. WantsThe stated goal of U.S. policymakers is equal treatment for U.S. technology. American internet companies are kept out of China and every niche has a Chinese imitator, because China wants absolute control over what its people say and see. One in five U.S. companies claim China has stolen its intellectual property. Chinese products are accused of being used to spy, which is why the U.S. is cracking down on Huawei.Unfortunately, that war has already been lost. China is integral to the global supply chain, especially the U.S. supply chain. Every major U.S. tech manufacturer has close ties to China. That's because even educated Chinese labor is cheap and abundant.Every escalation in war rhetoric hits companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hard. Since things heated up in April, Apple is down 12%. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down nearly 30% from its April highs, a loss of around $20 billion. The Bottom LineThis administration doesn't care who it hurts in the pursuit of power, except Wall Street.If the trade war starts costing Wall Street big money, and moneymen stop listening to trade hawks in the name of profit, Trump will turn around as he did early this year, after the fall's tech wreck.It's all a game, a way of saying that America is still King of the World. Make America seem great again.But America isn't King of the World, nor should it be. A win-win deal can be made, and we should make it. We will, once the market tells this administration that it must, or we may see business go Democratic in 2020.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

3122,0.9898,"On bad days, a momentum stock like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) usually leads lower first. Instead, CRM stock was the one still trying to rally on a bad market day.Source: Shutterstock Why so much faith in CRM?This is the company that made the cloud a cool place to be, and it still reigns supreme there. Back then it competed against giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and won. This was no small feat so we have proof that management is competent enough to navigate these headline threats.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd while Salesforce is the company that first put the possibilities of the cloud in the spotlight, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the company that made it easy for all companies to join in on the fun. That migration trend will continue for the next few years, which means the demand for CRM products and services will also continue to grow.Moreover, the reasons that are scaring investors out of stocks here have nothing to do with CRM's profit and loss statement. Salesforce is not in the line of fire of the economic trade war between the U.S. and China. Sure, it could suffer indirectly from other companies contracting, but the services that CRM provides will survive the early cuts in spending.During hard times, businesses don't eliminate what makes them efficient.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends Fundamentally, Salesforce stock is not cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 103. This is almost four times more expensive than MSFT or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But for now, and for as long as it grows this fast, this is not an issue.Hyper-growth companies like CRM need to spend a lot to feed the growth. So, for now, Wall Street still gives it a pass on profitability.Technically, CRM stock is tight and a momentum stock like this doesn't stay tight for long. That means there is a move coming  … but in which direction? How to Approach CRM Stock TodaySince support for CRM just below its current price has held all year, I assume that the bears need new reasons to sell it lower. So the upside scenario is more likely to happen than a debacle.But as with all assumptions, we also have to consider the opposite scenario. So if this market-wide malaise lingers, then Salesforce.com stock is vulnerable to $144 per share. That zone was the 2019 breakout level and it should provide support on the way down.And since we are still in intense headline mode, I wouldn't suggest taking a full position all at once. Instead, I suggest that you do it in tranches.

3126,0.996,"On Tuesday afternoon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced an updated version of the iPod Touch. Its most affordable iOS device now has an A10 processor and up to 256GB of storage. Sales of iPods hardly move the needle on Apple stock these days -- that's why every other iPod model has long been discontinued -- so why bother with a new iPod Touch?Source: Apple And if the company is going to update the device, why such a minor bump instead of a modern design with features like a more recent processor and a larger display?Both decisions are wrapped up in Apple's strategy to keep driving revenue and profitability as iPhone growth slows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple Announces New iPod TouchOn May 28, Apple announced the release of a new iPod Touch. Last updated in 2015, the 7th generation of the device gains an A10 processor (up from the previous generation's A8) and a new 256GB storage option (up from a maximum of 128GB). Otherwise, hardware remains exactly the same, including a 4-inch Retina display, an 8MP primary camera, HD FaceTime camera and a headphone jack.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Starting at $199, the price of the new iPod Touch climbs to $399 for users who choose the 256GB option.  Why a New iPod Touch Instead of Simply Discontinuing the Device?Apple killed the iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle in 2017, leaving the iPod Touch as the sole remaining iPod. At that time it did get a storage boost, but in terms of what really counts -- the processor and display -- Apple hasn't updated its entry level iOS device in four years. So why make a move now instead of simply closing the door on the iPod era altogether?  It's all about the iPhone, the device that succeeded the iPod as the primary driver of AAPL profit and the reason why Apple stock is as valuable as it is today. With iPhone sales slowing, the company has been pushing services to pick up the revenue slack. We've actually been expecting Apple to make this move. In fact, there was a possibility a new iPod Touch would make its debut at Apple's March special event. At $199, the last remaining iPod is by far the cheapest Apple device that can be used for streaming Apple Music or watching the new Apple TV+ streaming video service. In its press release, APPL notes that the new version offers &quot;performance that is twice as fast as before.&quot; With the upgrade to an A10 processor, the iPod Touch can take advantage of Apple Arcade -- the company's new paid gaming service that launches this fall. The new processor also ensures a few more years of iOS updates for the iPod Touch, helping Apple to avoid the fragmentation issue that plagues Android, and continues to make life complicated for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.In short, with the cheapest new iPhone XR starting at $749 the new iPod Touch is an important gateway for ensuring as many customers as possible can pay for those Apple subscription services.  Why Just a Spec Refresh?So why not bother updating any of the other components? A bigger, higher resolution display for example? And why go with the three year-old A10 processor instead of something more recent?That comes down to Apple's current approach to maximize profitability from its hardware.Innovation has taken a bit of a back seat in favor of minor upgrades. This keeps hardware costs down, and maximizes profit margins. In the case of the iPod Touch, the rest of the hardware is deemed &quot;good enough&quot; as is the move to a processor from 2016.Offering storage updates at $100 a pop means Apple can squeeze even more profit out of buyers -- a strategy it also employs with iPhones. Skipping a modern redesign of the device also prevents the iPod Touch from cannibalizing iPad or iPhone sales. And the old form factor keeps the headphone jack -- so the company can point critics to the new iPod Touch as a headphone-friendly music listening option.  * 4 Consumer Staples Stocks for Both Income and Growth The new iPod Touch may not sell like gangbusters, but the units Apple does move will be highly profitable for the company. Especially if buyers decide to pay extra for additional storage. And each iPod Touch sold is another potential subscriber to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple Arcade. All good for AAPL revenue and profitability, and nothing but upside for Apple stock.      As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since then it's dropped by more than 11% to $155, edging closer to its 52-week low of $129.77.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrAlibaba can't get any respect. As my InvestorPlace colleague Vince Martin recently said, Alibaba delivered a home-run quarter, and yet it couldn't move higher suggesting that almost nothing is going to act as a catalyst for BABA stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI agree with that assessment. However, investing is a game of patience. As Alibaba flirts with value territory, aggressive investors who believe in its business model are going to take advantage of the latest dip in the Alibaba stock price. Here's why you should too.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement  Good Things Come to Those Who WaitNot only did Martin point out that BABA has been unable to benefit from a strong quarter, but he also highlighted the fact that Alibaba's stock only has gained 69% since its second day of trading after its September 2014 IPO, underperforming many other internet-related tech companies. If you've owned it since 2014, you must be wondering whether BABA stock is ever going to match its potential. &quot;There's a case that Alibaba stock is going to rise eventually as long as it keeps performing,&quot; Martin wrote May 24. &quot;And is it really that impossible to believe that BABA could at some point pass the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and become the world's most valuable company? That's the uber-bull case for BABA: dominant share in the world's largest market means it could become the world's biggest company at some point.&quot;Despite being pro-Alibaba, I've never gotten that excited about the company, although I did suggest in May 2017 that Jack Ma could become the next Jeff Bezos.  However, now that Ma has stepped back from the business, it's up to Daniel Zhang to get Alibaba over the mountain.  A Look at Alibaba Stock for NowIn early May I wrote about what Alibaba needs to do for its stock to get to $250. At the time it was trading 21% higher than where it is as I write this. For me, it boils down to international expansion, the cloud, and its other investments. On the expansion front, Alibaba announced earlier in May that it was opening its ecommerce platform AliExpress to sellers in Italy, Russia, Spain, and Turkey to be able to sell to other countries on the company's third-party platform. It is part of Alibaba's globalization strategy. &quot;We are seeing Alibaba trying to expand globally because they are trying to offset declining growth in China itself,&quot; said Billy Leung, a director at Haitong, a Chinese securities firm. &quot;They are at the point when they need a lot of growth to come from AliExpress and Lazada and other international businesses.&quot;Sure, growth at home is shrinking, but it's not as if it's terrible. In fiscal 2019, its China retail marketplaces generated $853 billion of gross merchandise value (GMV), 19% higher than a year earlier. Furthermore, its China commerce retail business, which accounts for 63% of revenue, grew 40% year over year to $36.9 billion. That's plenty of business if it continues to grow its international e-commerce. I believe actions like the announcement in May suggest it's on its way.    Alibaba Stock and the CloudThe other key point if Alibaba stock wants to get to $250 is that its cloud business has got to start making money. In fiscal 2019, the company's cloud segment grew revenue 84% to $3.7 billion. However, it lost $172 million on an adjusted EBITDA basis, 5% higher than a year earlier. That said, its margins improved slightly during the year, holding a glimmer of hope that it can get to breakeven in fiscal 2020. There's no doubt that its cloud business is a big deal in China. Like its e-commerce, investors are waiting to see how things go outside China. Investors are looking for a catalyst outside its home market. The Bottom Line on BABA StockAlibaba generated $15.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2019. That's 28% of its overall revenue. By comparison, Amazon's free cash flow is just 8% of its total sales. Yet, Amazon trades at 27 times cash flow compared to 19 times for Alibaba. My take on this latest correction: back the truck up and buy away.

3168,-0.6574,"For a brief few days, it looked as if Nokia (NYSE:NOK) might be on the mend. Off nearly 30% from its January peak as of mid-May, NOK stock bounced nearly 10% after the U.S. banned imported products made by rival Huawei.Source: Shutterstock That budding uptrend, however, was up-ended on Thursday, with Nokia stock tumbling 3.0% for no news-driven reason.It's difficult to ferret out the impact the broad market tide has had on NOK stock. At times the Nokia stock price has moved in tandem with the herd; other times, it hasn't. Shares have been particularly weak since March, and downright terrible since late April, severely underperforming the overall market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat disconnect, however, may also prove to be an opportunity right now, in an environment that looks and feels more bearish than not. Indeed, the trip back to the consensus target price of $6.54 is a relatively short and straightforward one, especially given the news backdrop. Lots of Bark, Not Much BiteIt's not without its problems. Chief among them is the bevy of class-action lawsuits in preparation right now, arguing that Nokia's due diligence regarding the 2015 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent was inadequate. The company disclosed in March that some Alcatel-Lucent practices were concerning, and possibly not compliant with all applicable laws.  * 4 Reasons the Next 12 Months Will Make or Break AT&T Stock In the meantime, Nokia has fallen into the same quagmire as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), facing lawsuits that claim the company -- in violation of U.S. antitrust law -- conspired with other patent holders to improperly inflate the price of some of its wireless connectivity technologies used in automobiles. The EU's antitrust regulators, at the request of Daimler (OTCMKTS:DMLRY), are also probing the same possibility in preparation of a suit.There's probably something to it. The proverbial &quot;pushing of the envelope&quot; is the norm on the modern technology landscape, with collusion (spoken and unspoken) not being entirely uncommon and lawsuits -- merited or not -- serving as a means of disrupting rivals. Even the venerable Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently lost a fairly flimsy patent suit against Qualcomm, extending a long-standing saga between the two tech giants.As history has shown though -- particularly with Qualcomm and Apple -- these patent-driven problems mean very little in the end. Apple's total liability with its recent loss to Qualcomm? Only $31 million -- petty cash for the multi-billion dollar company.Indeed, not even regulatory bodies wield as big of a weapon as the headlines generally imply, setting the stage for what could be an easy rebound for NOK stock, especially in light of the United States' recent ban on China's Huawei-made technology.Don't be too detracted by the headlines. With Huawei Out of the Way…Not even Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri was willing to say exactly how much he thought it might prove a boon to the company. But, he was willing to say that with Huawei's 5G tech out of the picture for the time being, &quot;Perhaps there is long term opportunity.&quot;He was underselling the prospect.The world has largely responded to the White House's plea to assist it in keeping China, via Huawei, in check. Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is re-scrutinizing its business relationship with the company. Google, which maintains the Android operating system employed by Huawei smartphones, will for the time being not facilitate any OS updates of Huawei devices. UK-based chipmaker ARM is suspending business with China's Huawei as well, accommodating the United States' action.These are all actions that will indirectly be interpreted as positives for Nokia, because they are.Not that the company wasn't already making some bigger waves on its own. Even as Suri suggested Nokia is a few weeks behind in the 5G race, he also noted at this month's shareholder meeting that NOK now has &quot;37 5G commercial contracts -- 20 with named customers including T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&T (NYSE:T), STC, and Telia -- and more than half of them include wider portfolio elements that our competitors cannot match.&quot; Looking Ahead for NOK StockNOK stock still travels in something of a vacuum, doing its own thing rather than the market's thing. This could be good, or bad, or both, depending on the backdrop.Given the opportunity and the technical context at hand, however, it's difficult to think Nokia stock won't be back at $6.54 sooner than later; its sheer volatility may do most of that work. Zooming out to the weekly chart of Nokia stock it's clear that wild, wide swings are the norm.Also note that the upper edge of the two-year trading range is around $6.64, just above the consensus target of $6.54. That leaves NOK stock plenty of leeway.Again, the lawsuits mean little, in the end. The addition of several new 5G contracts on top of previously-made ones, however, is just the kind of rhetoric that can lift a stock out of the drugs.To that end, analysts are hopeful again.  * 7 Stocks to Buy From One of America's Best Pension Funds While revenue is expected to slip about 3% this year, the pros say it will grow by the same amount next year. That should drive this year's projected profit of 25 cents per share of NOK stock to 39 cents next year, on the heels of Nokia's 5G ramp-up. The company wouldn't even really have to turn that revenue into a meaningful profit though. The mere promise should be enough.Welcome to the game… understanding the difference between news and noise, and figuring out how the crowd is going to interpret each.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3172,0.9983,"In a world where investors focus on the tech stocks of the future, the equities representing the products we use every day often get ignored. When many investors hear &quot;consumer staples stocks,&quot; they tend to think of names such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) or Clorox (NYSE:CLX). While those firms may make the products necessary for people's lives, they might also struggle to attract investor interest.However, investors should take a closer look at consumer staples stocks. Consumer staples is a diverse category, and some subsectors generate investor excitement. It can include consumer electronics. Additionally, the emerging marijuana and hemp sectors have also reinvigorated interest in consumer stocks.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Moreover, due to depressed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for many consumer staples stocks, some offer not only deep value, but also increased cash payouts. These four consumer-oriented equities provide a unique opportunity for significant cash payouts and stock-price growth:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)Source: Apple Consumers often forget that some consumer staples stocks come with a tech focus. Such is the case with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company has long depended on the iPhone for the majority of its revenue. However, amid competition, consumers have shown less willingness to pay Apple's premium prices. Moreover, traders also worry about how the U.S.-China trade war will affect the company. As a result, AAPL stock remains in a bear market.The good news for AAPL longs is that arguably no other company is better positioned to reinvent itself than Apple. In recent months, the company has ventured into streaming media, credit cards, information, and other businesses in an attempt to return to double-digit growth. Even after investing in some of these areas, their cash hoard stood at $225.4 billion at the end of the first quarter.Moreover, their trailing P/E ratio stands at about 15.4. While profits will likely stagnate this year, analysts forecast that Apple will return to double-digit profit growth in 2020. Furthermore, holders of AAPL stock now earn an annual dividend of $3.08 per share. Though this brings the yield to only about 1.6%, investors should note that payouts have increased every year since they began in 2012.Apple stock may struggle in the near term as the company explores new revenue streams and deals with a trade war. However, once the company profits from new businesses and the U.S. and China agree on trade, AAPL stock should again resume its move higher. Greif (GEF)Source: Apple Greif (NYSE:GEF) may not serve as one of the better-known consumer staples stocks. However, its packaging plays a vital role in the industrial sector. Moreover, the company's financial metrics may make some investors want to secure some GEF stock in their portfolio.Since the beginning of 2018, concerns about a slowing economy weighed on GEF stock. Investor worries worsened with the purchase of Caraustar industries earlier year. As a result, GEF trades at a discount of more than 40% from its 52-week high.The forecasted earnings growth of only 4.2% this year may explain some of the stock's decline. Still, profits have typically increased at double-digit rates in the past. Wall Street predicts that that growth rate will return next year with a 12% increase forecasted.Moreover, this also leaves its trailing P/E ratio at just 9.7 times earnings. This compares well to other consumer staples stocks as many trade at a multiple above 20.  * 5 Large-Cap Stocks Getting Crushed in the Trade War Investors should also pay attention to the dividend. The annual payout of $1.76 per share takes the yield to around 4.75%. While that dividend does not increase every year, it has gradually moved higher over time. Between this payout and the low multiple, GEF stock holds tremendous potential as both a growth and an income play. United Breweries (CCU)Source: Shutterstock United Breweries (NYSE:CCU), known in its native Chile as Compañia Cervecerias Unidas S.A., is the number one producer of beer in Chile. United Breweries also derives a significant percentage of its revenue from Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Despite the beer-oriented name, the company also sells wine, spirits, and non-alcoholic drinks.Chile has gradually become one of Latin America's wealthiest countries. CCU stock has grown with the country. Despite this growth, CCU stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 10.4.Volatility may partially explain the low multiple in CCU stock. Analysts expect profits to increase by 76.9% this year. However, in 2020, they forecast an earnings decline of 26.2%. Still, they predict that growth to average 11.37% per year over the next five years. This represents a turnaround from previous years as profits had shrunk more often than not.That positive growth should also reduce the volatility of its dividend. The company will pay out $1.32 per share in dividends this year. That translates to a yield of 5.0% at current prices. Despite the yield and the improving profit picture, investors need to prepare for some fluctuation in the payout. The company paid only 36 cents per share in 2018, down from 56 cents per share in 2017.CCU stock will require stockholders to exercise patience with the ups and downs. However, for those that can handle the volatility, CCU should remain one of the consumer staples stocks that should have investors raising a glass. Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS)Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) utilizes multilevel marketing and social media to sell its dietary and skin-care products. It began operations in 1984 and sells its products under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands. Though it didn't sell outside of the U.S. until 1990, non-U.S. sales now account for about 88% of revenues.Consequently, worries about currency risk and trade in the second quarter have weighed on NUS stock, and it has struggled in recent days. The Provo, Utah-based firm spiked higher by 19% after beating on earnings and revenue in its 1Q 2019 report. However, in subsequent trading sessions, it has given most of that gain back as trade-related uncertainty returns. NUS stock trades at more than 40% below its 52-week high.However, that creates an opportunity among consumer staples stocks. Despite these worries, earnings forecasts for both this year and next have moved higher over the last 30 days. More importantly, these revisions point to double-digit earnings increases for both 2019 and 2020. This has helped to take its forward P/E ratio to around 11.7.  * 5 Retail Stocks Getting Slaughtered This Earnings Season Also, thanks to the decline in the stock, the $1.48 dividend yields almost 2.9%. Since this payout has increased every year for the past 18 years, investors can probably expect the annual payout hikes to continue. Both the high, increasing payout and the low P/E ratio position NUS stock for both growth and income once trade war-related tensions ease.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

More Bad News for Intel The announcement of the 3rd generation Ryzen processors is just the latest bad news for Intel. The company's 5G mobile modem plans were scuttled in April after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dumped Intel in favor of settling with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). And two weeks ago, a new high profile computer processor vulnerability called ZombieLoad was made public -and this one affected Intel CPUs only, with AMD Ryzen chips unaffected.When it comes to computer processors, what's bad news for Intel is often good news for Advanced Micro Devices, and AMD stock.   Accelerant for GrowthAfter years of foundering by AMD, the Ryzen series of processors have led to a resurgence for the company's PC ambitions. In February, the company announced that its marketshare in PC processors had topped levels from 2014, with the share of the PC laptop market at its highest level since 2013.In fact, AMD has been making gains against Intel in all aspects of the computer market: desktop, laptop and server.The new, 3rd generation  Ryzen chips are positioned to continue AMD's PC market resurgence. In particular, the Ryzen 9 3900X is being called out as a potential game changer. AMD says the high-powered, 12-core processor topped Intel's flagship Core i9-9920X in performance testing by more than 16%. The AMD chip also uses far less power.But the kicker is the price. The Intel chip -- which made its debut in Q4 2018 -- sells for nearly $1,200. AMD has priced the Ryzen 9 3900X at just $499… Plenty of Upside for AMD StockFor AMD investors, the news out of Computex is good. In particular, the value proposition of the new Ryzen 9 3900X has the potential to win over PC gamers -- and make rival Intel scramble. While not the biggest demographic among computer users, that crowd helps to set trends. Where they go, mainstream PC users may follow.And if gamers are moving to an AMD processor, there's a better chance they'll also upgrade to a new AMD Radeon video card.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement There's plenty of room for AMD stock to gain this year before it hits the levels it reached last fall (peaking near $33), let alone historic highs near the $45 range. And the latest series of Zen desktop processors are set to provide the fuel for that growth.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The next major milestone is whether President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Japan next month.The White House is reportedly considering even more restrictions on exports of high-tech goods to China, as it seems that what started as a bilateral trade spat is turning into a global tech war, with the United States pulling allies such as Japan into its effort to freeze out Huawei.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer With no end in sight, investors are bracing for the worst: A long disruption to global supply chains and closed access to Chinese consumers. As a result, a number of large-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are looking vulnerable to a selloff.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are four stocks to sell now: Dow Jones Stocks to Sell Now: United Technologies (UTX)Shares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have crossed back below their 50-day moving average, down more than 10% from their early May high, after hitting double-top resistance from the late September levels. Watch for a test of critical support near the 200-day moving average, which would give way to a possible test of the late December lows, which would be worth a further loss of more than 20% from here.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.03 per share on revenues of $19.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of $1.91 per share beat estimates by 19 cents per share on a 20.5% rise in revenues. Caterpillar (CAT)Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) continue to melt lower, falling further away from their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The result is an ongoing retest of the late December lows, setting up a possible fall to the lower levels plumbed in October. That would be worth a loss of nearly 10% from here as investors brace for a decline in sales into China.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend The company is scheduled to next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.12 per share on revenues of $14.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $2.94 beat estimates by eight cents on a 4.7% rise in revenues. International Business Machines (IBM)International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock, which has been desperate to stay above its 200-day moving average for months, appears to be on the verge of a major breakdown, setting up a filling of the gap from January in what would be worth a loss of nearly 8% from here. In its most recent quarterly call, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance, which was disappointing considering a persistent inability to boost revenue growth after years of malaise.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 17 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.10 per share on revenues of $19.2 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of $2.25 beat estimates by a penny on a 4.7% decline in revenues.

3274,-0.9966,"On May 16, the U.S. Department of Commerce put China's Huawei on the &quot;Entity List&quot; as a national security threat. This move escalates a government campaign against the Chinese technology company beyond banning its products from sale in America. It means U.S. tech stocks are prohibited from selling sensitive tech to Huawei. Several days later, Huawei was given a 90-day temporary reprieve, but the damage is already being felt throughout the tech sector.U.S. technology companies from chip makers to software providers are seeing their stock impacted by the Huawei ban. Some are being hit despite not being directly involved with Huawei -- the move has further ramped up a trade war between China and the U.S. and that brings the threat of boycotts and retaliatory tariffs.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them From Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), here are 10 tech stocks that are feeling the effects of the U.S. ban on Huawei.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tech Stocks Walloped by the Huawei Ban: Intel (INTC)Source: Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sells processors to Huwaei for use in its laptops. Since the Huawei ban was announced on May 16, Intel stock has dropped. The company doesn't depend heavily on Huawei -- Bloomberg estimates that business is less than 1% of Intel's total revenue -- but losing it doesn't help.Especially when it comes just weeks after Intel lost Apple's iPhone business to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and ended up abandoning its 5G mobile modem efforts altogether. Micron (MU)Source: Micron Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a U.S.-based semiconductor company. And it happens to supply the flash storage chips used in Huawei's popular smartphones, including the new P30 Pro.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend When the sales ban was announced, Micron's business with Huawei was effectively cut off. Even with the relief of the temporary 90-day reprieve, Micron stock has taken a hit, down 8% from Friday morning. Google (GOOGL)Source: Google Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division is in the thick of the Huawei mess.Google doesn't stand to lose much revenue in terms of hardware -- its Pixel smartphones and Google Nest Home smart speakers don't really have a presence in the China -- but software and advertising revenue are another matter. When the Huawei ban was announced, Google pulled Huawei's Android license. New Huawei smartphones won't get stock Android and they won't have access to Google services. The prospect of the second largest smartphone maker in the world being severed from Google (cutting into Android licensing fees, Google Search ad revenue and Google Play revenue) has resulted in GOOGL stock sliding since last Friday. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Tesla TSLA has been on a dramatic downward trajectory all week, for many reasons that have nothing to do with Huawei. But Telsa stock is also feeling the indirect impact of the U.S. government's move.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Are $6 or Less As the trade war heats up between China and the U.S., the prospect of new tariffs on goods imported into China and the potential for Chinese consumers to boycott American-made goods -- including Tesla's electric cars -- have led to some analysts to predict TSLA could miss its 2019 sales targets by as much as 10%. Lumentum (LITE)Source: Lumentum American telecommunication company Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE) primarily makes optical components used in  commercial lasers and networking equipment.Huawei is also big in networking equipment (it was security concerns over the Chinese company's push to supply 5G networking infrastructure that kicked off this current crisis), and it buys Lumentum components. As a result, Lumentum stock's drop neared double digits on the day the Huawei ban was announced. Qorvo (QRVO)Source: Qorvo Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is another U.S. semiconductor company, with a heavy involvement in wireless and broadband networking, including 5G.Half of the company's revenue comes from Chinese customers and in updated financial guidance released on May 21, Qorvo says 15% of its 2018 revenue came from Huawei.  * 5 Large-Cap Stocks Getting Crushed in the Trade War With that Huawei revenue in jeopardy and the Chinese market in general being increasingly affected by the trade war, Qorvo stock has dropped over 9%. Corning (GLW)Source: Corning Corning (NYSE:GLW) isn't always thought of as a technology company. But the American glass maker's products are used in a slew of high tech applications.One of those speciality products is the Gorilla Glass used to protect the displays of smartphones. And Huwaei is a Corning customer. With the business of the world's second largest producer of smartphones in jeopardy, Corning stock has taken a tumble this week. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another example of the tech stocks that have been negatively affected by the escalating trade war with China.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy When Huawei was added to the Entity List, Broadcom announced it would stop selling components to the Chinese company. As a result, AVGO is down over 9% since the Huawei ban was first announced. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: AMD Ordinarily, any time that a PC maker parted ways with Intel would be a big opportunity for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and its increasingly popular Ryzen processors.That's not the case with the Huawei situation … AMD reportedly stands to lose 2% of its revenue by cutting off its business with Huawei. And the company could also suffer if increased tariffs hit its CPU and GPU business with other Chinese PC makers. AMD stock has taken a hit of as much as 7% since the Huawei ban was announced. Apple (AAPL)Source: Apple AAPL stock finds itself in a strange position with the Huawei ban. Any measures that hurt Huawei's ability to sell smartphones should benefit Apple Inc, opening an opportunity to sell more iPhones.However, Apple is very vulnerable to the overall trade war with China that Huwaei is a part of. Most of the company's iPhones are assembled in China. And although iPhone sales have been slowing in China, the Chinese market, is still an important revenue stream for Apple. If China were to retaliate and ban Apple products from being sold there, a Goldman Sachs analyst estimated Apple's profits could take a 30% hit.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy So Apple joins the long list of tech stocks that are being impacted by the Huwaei sales ban, with AAPL down roughly 8% since Friday.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3289,0.9937,"In 2015, a year after Satya Nadella became its CEO and committed his company to the cloud, I put some Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares in my retirement account and forgot about them. My patience has been rewarded. A $53 investment in MSFT stock is worth almost $127 now, and reinvesting dividends has brought me more shares, which have also risen in value.Source: Shutterstock With a market cap of $972 billion, Microsoft is now the world's most valuable company, and despite his earnest philanthropy, co-founder Bill Gates is worth over $100 billion.The question is how long can the company keep growing without getting into the same monopoly penalty box that kept it from reaching its 1999 highs until 2016?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's Nadella's challenge now. Spreading Bets Through CloudThe key is to continue spreading the company's bets, using the Azure cloud, growing as humbly as it can.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy The humility is evident in the company's numbers. Growth returned just two years ago, and net income was lower in fiscal 2018 than in 2017. But Nadella was using the time to build infrastructure and relationships. The big benefits have begun appearing in the last six months. At its present pace, Microsoft will bring in well over $120 billion of revenue and over $30 billion of net income during fiscal 2019, adding to a cash pile that had reached $131 billion at the end of March. Microsoft has already piled up over $21 billion in operating cash flow through the first half of the fiscal year. Forget it becoming IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft is now Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).The key lies in partnering with other companies and not trying to consume them. Microsoft has over 200 cloud partners, most of which you have never heard of, for whom its tools are essential. Microsoft has deep relationships with companies like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). But it has avoided a big acquisition that might lead rivals to compare it with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which bought many of its database channel partners in the 2000s, then demanded monopoly rents.The best evidence for how well this works is a recent announcement with Sony (NYSE:SNE) on gaming and streaming. The two firms' consoles have battled each other for decades. But in the new field of cloud gaming, they position themselves as underdogs against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which are already in the field. Good to Not Be KingThe strength of other cloud czars is Microsoft's secret weapon in any battle with regulators.Windows is no longer a monopoly thanks to Google Chromebooks. Skype is barely mentioned in video calling -- the focus is all on Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM). No one worries about LinkedIn because Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is so dominant.The acquisitions Microsoft is making are on the bleeding edge, in the Internet of Things, where it trails Chinese giants like Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA). Microsoft was seen as a good home for Github, the open source repository, because it's seen as more neutral than other potential acquirers, like IBM, might be. The Bottom LineIn his most recent conference call, Nadella emphasized areas like security, hardware and social, where the company clearly trails market leaders.But Microsoft Azure is the most profitable cloud. Microsoft booked $9.7 billion of revenue as &quot;intelligent cloud&quot; during the quarter, with margins of over 20%, putting $3.4 billion of new capital to work there. Again, thank goodness for Amazon. No one is screaming about an &quot;Azure monopoly.&quot;So long as Nadella can keep spreading his bets, Microsoft and investors like me will keep smiling all the way to the bank.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

3296,0.0672,"U.S. equities came under serious and growing pressure on Thursday as the U.S.-China trade spat devolved into an outright global trade war with countries Japan and South Korea getting caught in the crossfire. The Trump Administration is raising the stakes with its efforts to block Huawei from using American technology, pushing allies like South Korea to do the same.Beijing is firing back with calls to boycott American tech firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and threats to dump its U.S. Treasury bonds holdings -- totaling more than $1 trillion. Wall Street is finally waking up to the possibility that this problem is going to get worse before it gets better. And it can get a lot worse.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen back below its 200-day moving average, the U.S. dollar is dropping hard, and U.S. Treasury yields are falling fast amid a rush to safe haven assets. The yield curve is also inverting again, which is a loud and clear signal that on this trajectory, a recession looms ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend As a result, a number of large-cap stocks are dropping hard and fast. Here are five stocks to sell: Amazon (AMZN)  Click to EnlargeFirst up is one of the largest of the large cap stocks. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are threatening to fall down below the $1,800 level, breaking below their 50-day moving average after weeks of flirting with that critical support level. Next stop is the 200-day moving average which would then give way to the January-March lows near $1,600 which would be worth a loss of nearly 12% from here.The company will next report results on July 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.48 per share on revenues of $62.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $7.09 beat estimates by $2.43 per share on a 17% rise in revenues. Chevron (CVX)  Click to EnlargeWith traders bracing for a global economic slowdown as a result of rising trade tensions, crude oil is plummeting with the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:USO) down more than 6% in intra-day trading to return to levels not seen since early March. That's pushing down shares of oil large-cap stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) hard, with shares threatening to fall below its 200-day moving average.  * The 7 Best Stocks to Buy From the IPO ETF The company will next report results on July 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.03 per share on revenues of $41.7 billion. When the company last reported on April 26, earnings of $1.39 beat estimates by six cents despite a 6.8% loss of revenues. Bank of America (BAC)  Click to EnlargeLower long-term interest rates means narrower net interest margins for banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). So it's not surprising shares are dropping fast, falling below the 200-day moving it's tried desperately to stay above since January. If support from the March lows doesn't hold, watch for a possible drop all the way back to the December lows, which would be worth a loss of nearly 20% from here.The large cap stock will next report results on July 17 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 72 cents per share on revenues of $23.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of 70 cents per share beat estimates by four cents on a 0.4% drop in revenues. NVIDIA (NVDA)  Click to EnlargeShares of semiconductor large-cap stock NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are melting lower, breaking down further away from its 50-day and 200-day moving averages as all the catalysts that bolstered shares for so long -- cryptocurrency mining, gaming consoles, etc. -- are working against it now. Watch for a quick trip down to the prior lows set in late December, which would be worth a loss of roughly 14% from here.  * 6 Innovative Stocks With Big Long-Term Growth Potential The company will next report results on August 15. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.14 per share on revenues of $2.6 billion. When the company last reported on May 16, earnings of 88 cents per share beat estimates by seven cents on a 30.8% decline in revenues. Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeNo list of large-cap stocks would be complete without a look at Apple, which is at the very epicenter of the U.S.-China trade spat. The next round of trade tariffs being proposed by President Trump will hit the company's products directly, weighing on profit margins. The company has been able to avoid the brunt of the damage to date because of its importance to overall S&P 500 earnings growth and thus market sentiment, something Trump is acutely aware of.But that's changing now.

3305,0.9984,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are two of the four largest U.S. companies by market cap. Apple stock has taken a much larger hit than GOOGL stock during the May trade-war sell-off. However, long-term investors looking to buy the Apple dip should consider taking a close look at GOOGL stock first.Source: Shutterstock At first glance, there are several reasons why an investor looking to buy the dip might choose Apple stock. AAPL is down 11% in May compared to only a 1.8% pullback from Google. However, year-to-date, Apple is still up 18% overall compared to only a 10% gain from Alphabet stock. In fact, Alphabet stock price has actually lagged the S&P 500 so far in 2019.Still, from a pure valuation perspective, Apple looks like the better buy. Apple's forward earnings multiple is a relatively low 14.3 compared to Alphabet's 21.3. In fact, Apple has a lower forward earnings multiple than Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Finally, Apple stock has one of the most pristine balance sheets on Wall Street. In addition to its cash pile of $225 billion, the company is committed to putting the cash to use. AAPL stock pays a 1.6% dividend.The company just authorized an additional $75 billion in buybacks. Management has also said it is committed to becoming &quot;net cash neutral&quot; over time. At the same time, GOOGL stock has no dividend and has only $12.5 committed to repurchases under its current buyback program. Apple Is Shrinking, Alphabet Is GrowingWhile Apple seems like a better value based on today's numbers, investing is about the future. In the most recent quarter, Apple's revenue was down 4.5% and net income was down 0.5% compared to a year ago. Alphabet, meanwhile, reported 17% revenue growth in the first quarter. Excluding a one-time fine by the European Commission, operating income was up 26% to $8.31 billion.Google stock was punished following its Q1 report because revenue growth was its slowest in three years, and its expenses continue to rise. Investors certainly shouldn't ignore those potential issues, as well as the possibility for additional regulation. But they should also not miss the forest for the trees.Apple bulls say the company will overcome an increasingly saturated smartphone market and return to growth in time. The plan is to shrink the iPhone refresh period and improving monetization of its existing customers. However, Google is already growing at a double-digit pace. More importantly, it does not derive the majority of its revenue from selling devices in a saturated market.Former Kase Capital Management hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson says he disagrees with his investing idol Warren Buffett when it comes to Apple versus Google.&quot;My money - unlike my investing hero, Warren Buffett - is on Alphabet significantly outperforming Apple in the long run because it has a better business model, is growing much faster, and is likely to continue doing so,&quot; Tilson says. Alphabet Stock Is Safer Than Apple StockTech investors should consider why they like tech in the first place before buying the May dip. Apple is a great company. Apple is a safe, solid long-term investment. But tech investors aren't typically looking for a blue chip company with a nice dividend yield and relatively stable earnings. That's why investors don't typically lump Microsoft in with discussions of the FANG stocks.Investors looking for a defensive tech bet in a diversified portfolio can sleep well at night owning Apple. However, Tilson says investors looking for better performance over the long-haul have a better choice staring them in the face.&quot;To be clear, both are insanely great companies and I think Apple's stock will also do well going forward - just not as well as Alphabet's,&quot; Tilson says.The Alphabet stock price will continue to benefit from several long-term secular trends. The digital transformation of the advertising and retail businesses are the biggest. The company also has several &quot;wild card&quot; growth projects under its wing, including its Google Cloud and Waymo autonomous vehicle technology subsidiaries.Technology investors looking for stable capital returns at the expense of growth should buy AAPL stock. Investors looking for massive growth numbers and a sky-high valuation should buy NFLX stock. But long-term investors looking for the best value-growth combo should consider GOOGL stock as a core holding.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3307,0.9548,"What's interesting about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is that it has been a much better company than an investment. It's hard to argue that Alibaba hasn't lived up to expectations since its IPO nearly five years ago. Yet it hasn't done all that much for the BABA stock price.Source: Shutterstock Since its first-day close just under $94, Alibaba stock has risen about 69%. That's good performance, certainly, suggesting roughly a 12% annual appreciation. But over that stretch, BABA has actually underperformed large-capitalization tech stocks, as measured by the NASDAQ 100. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has returned 472%. The 179% return in Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is more than double the increase in BABA shares.Yet it's hard to argue that Alibaba as a business has been a disappointment. It's clearly, as many hoped five years ago, the dominant e-commerce player in China. Revenue for fiscal year 2019 (ending March) was more than seven-times higher than it was in fiscal 2014. Sales have grown an average of 48% over that period, including a 51% increase in FY19. Margins have compressed somewhat, but adjusted net income still has risen 230%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Alibaba has done its job, but it doesn't feel like it's been rewarded enough. The question is when, or if that will change. Recent trading suggests it might take quite a bit of time. Alibaba Stock Slumps After EarningsThe reaction to Alibaba earnings last week seems to highlight the problem for BABA. By any measure, Q4 earnings were close to spectacular. Both profits and revenue crushed analyst expectations. Dana Blankenhorn wrote that the report &quot;blast[ed] away the bears&quot;. Luce Emerson said the quarter was &quot;stellar.&quot;Those analyses all seem dead on. Yet the BABA stock price increased just 1.5% after the release. In the five sessions since, it's dropped over 10%. Shares are down 20% just since May 3rd.The obvious culprit is fear of a trade war and what it might do to the Chinese economy. But that's not the only explanation. Alibaba's chief e-commerce rival, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), has seen its shares drop just 11% since the third of this month, with a strong earnings report of its own. Even Tencent shares are down less than 17%.One might think given its scale, its massive user base -- 654 million customers last year -- and its clear dominance in e-commerce, Alibaba stock might have some insulation from those broader fears. Yet it's underperforming other publicly traded Chinese companies. The Long-Term Problem for BABA StockBut, again, this isn't a one-time issue. Alibaba simply hasn't been that impressive an equity over time. Basically, investors have had one good year. That was 2017, when the BABA stock price skyrocketed 96%. Shares are now below where they traded before the beginning of 2018.One issue may be that some investors simply see too many risks with Alibaba stock. Indeed, I'm one of them, as I've written in the past. The Chinese economy still looks worrisome and remains Communist-controlled. A steadily weakening yuan certainly hasn't helped BABA or other China plays of late. Alibaba's accounting is opaque, to say the least. The VIE structure means U.S. investors don't actually own shares of Alibaba, but a Cayman Islands-listed entity.Those risks may be short-sighted as some bulls argue. But they also mean that every time the market gets nervous, BABA stock is going to sell off. The trading action of the last week isn't anything new. Alibaba shares, 2017 aside, simply haven't been able to maintain a consistent rally. How to Play BABAWhat's interesting about the long-running problem is that bulls very well could -- and likely do -- see it as a good thing. Continual pressure on the share price might cause short-term frustration. However, it also presents repeated buying opportunities.After all, there's a case that Alibaba stock is going to rise eventually as long as it keeps performing. And is it really that impossible to believe that BABA could at some point pass the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and become the world's most valuable company? That's the uber-bull case for BABA: dominant share in the world's largest market means it could become the world's biggest company at some point.But even if Alibaba can get there, it's going to take some time, and quite a bit of patience. The risks here are real, and it's clear at this point that BABA stock is going to react to external factors as much as, if not more than its own performance. Put another way, if BABA stock can't gain after this type of earnings report, it's difficult to see what catalyst there might be.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

He estimates that Apple&apos;s advertising business could bring in $3 billion to $4 billion in revenue over the next three to five years, while AppleTV+ could bring in $3 billion to $6 billion. &quot;On net, we consider these findings to be incrementally bullish, but also heavily contingent on strong execution,&quot; wrote Sacconaghi, who has a market perform rating and $190 target on the stock.

3526,0.9949,"Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the global leader in streaming audio. And it's making moves toward becoming a podcasting powerhouse. However, some of the company's key competitors have big advantages over Spotify. These larger, more established companies have their own voice assistants, their own music hardware and their own systems becoming directly integrated into vehicle entertainment systems. After months of rumors, SPOT announced that it is taking a step toward building its own hardware, starting with the automobile. The Spotify Car Thing has broken cover, a voice-controlled device with one purpose: to play Spotify music while driving.Source: Spotify  Spotify Joins Streaming Music Rivals in the CarAmong the top four streaming music services (by paid subscribers), Spotify is currently the only one that doesn't offer its own hardware solution for vehicles. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has CarPlay, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has Android Auto. These systems support native, voice-controlled access to Apple Music and Google's various streaming music services.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- like Spotify -- relies on smartphones running software from Apple or Google to allow users to play its Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited in the car. To reduce that dependence somewhat (the smartphone is still needed but Alexa is front and center) Amazon announced the Echo Auto in 2018. Amazon's $49.99 voice-powered gadget brings Alexa into the car, including the ability to control Amazon's streaming music services. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Battery Stocks for High-Powered Gains Spotify just announced a similar device, which the company is calling the Car Thing. The Verge reported technical details on the new SPOT hardware. It is clearly designed to become the focus for a driver who wants to listen to music (or podcasts) while driving. The Spotify Car Thing plugs into a vehicle's 12v outlet for power, then connects to both the car stereo and the user's smartphone via Bluetooth. From there, drivers can control music playback via voice by saying &quot;Hey Spotify.&quot; The hardware includes a small display that shows details on what is bing played, and preset buttons for user playlists. SPOT Says Streaming Audio Remains the FocusCompetitors like Apple make the majority of their revenue through selling hardware. However, SPOT is insistent it doesn't have similar ambitions. The company was quite clear that music -- and podcasts -- will remain its priority.&quot;While we know there has been some speculation about our future plans, Car Thing was developed to help us learn more about how people listen to music and podcasts. Our focus remains on becoming the world's number one audio platform -- not on creating hardware.&quot; When Will the Spotify Car Thing be Available?Consumers may be waiting quite some time to get their hands on a Spotify Car Thing, and they may never get a crack at it. According to Spotify, testing starts shortly but only in the U.S. and only for a &quot;small group of invited Spotify Premium users.&quot;The company also says specifically that it has no current plans to make the Car Thing available to buy. So What's the Point?In the intro, I mentioned the Spotify Car Thing has one purpose. And yes, from a consumer's point of view being able to listen to Spotify Music and control it via voice would be the sole purpose of having a Car Thing. But what's Spotify's angle? Especially if the company isn't aiming for hardware revenue for diversification or to help reduce Spotify stock's reliance on subscriber growth?First, it would be a good idea to take the claims of not being interested in hardware with a grain of salt. If SPOT sold the Car Thing for $50 -- what Amazon is charging for the Echo Auto -- and you multiply that by even a fraction of the 100 million paid subscribers, there is real revenue potential there.The company also teased in its announcement that other hardware like a &quot;Home Thing&quot; could make a future appearance, so SPOT could be finally making a play for a share of a smart speaker market projected to be worth over $23 billion by 2025. Clearly revenue from hardware sales does have significant potential upside for Spotify stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Spotify itself spikes out a key reason for the Car Thing. Americans are spending 70 billion hours a year driving, and the company wants to learn more about how those drivers listen to music and podcasts. By getting involved at the hardware level, SPOT can capture more granular data. And that information could prove critical for the company as it fine-tunes its streaming services to remain number one amid fierce competition.  As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3535,0.5783,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning.Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.59%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.57%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.79%.In the options pits, call and put activity ended the day on equal footing, while overall volume fell to average levels. Specifically, about 16.2 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe relative calm made an impact at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.65 -- a three-week low. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched higher to 0.72.Options activity was hot in the following three stocks: Sprint (NYSE:S), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's take a closer look: Sprint (S)Traders swarmed telecom stocks after the Federal Communications Chairman, Ajit Pai, said he's in favor of the $26.5 billion merger between Sprint and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) that was announced in 2018. After a volatile intraday ride, S stock ended the day up 18.8%. TMUS gained 3.87%. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) joined the rally, though their gains were pared significantly by the closing bell.  * 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs With the surge, Sprint now sits at an eighteen month high. Before the pop, the stock was stuck in a sloppy range. Time will tell if a bona fide trend emerges. Until then, I suggest patience for Monday's gap to be digested and a better pattern to emerge.On the options trading front, puts surprisingly ruled the roost. Activity rocketed to 622% of the average daily volume, with 185,578 total contracts traded; 75% of the trading came from put options alone.With the resolution of the proposed merger now seemingly priced in, implied volatility dropped on the session to 93%. That places it at the 51st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 43 cents or 6%. Alibaba (BABA)Trade war jitters already had Alibaba shares on the ropes, but a nasty earnings report from Chinese internet giant, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) delivered the knockout blow. The losses in BABA stock since peaking last month have now grown to 18%, placing the company's shares a stone's throw from bear market territory.Yesterday's 5.3% drubbing was enough to push the stock back below its 200-day moving average for the first time since February. With it now pushing into oversold territory, a rebound may be in the cards, but it has high odds of failing. If anything a pop back toward $170 or $175 should be eyed as a potential shorting opportunity.As far as options trading goes, calls won the day by a slim margin. Total activity grew to 191% of the average daily volume, with 383,956 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 54% of the tally.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 35% placing it at the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.56 or 2.2%. Apple (AAPL)Apple is another victim of the latest round of tariff-induced trauma. In a client note, Credit Suisse highlighted the threat that further deterioration in the trade war poses to Apple earnings for 2019. With Greater China contributing 20% to the company's 2018 revenue and operating profit, the health of its economy is of utmost importance to Apple earnings.The recent drop in AAPL stock has it trading below all major moving averages. Watch for a break back above $192.50 resistance to signal that the short-term downtrend is reversing and bears have officially been evicted from the premises.On the options trading front, traders favored puts over calls. Activity held steady at 100% of the average daily volume, with 582,288 total contracts traded. Puts claimed 51% of the day's take.Implied volatility lifted to 33% or the 51st percentile of its one-year range.

It's as if the prior issues and controversies such as with privacy and security breaches have simply just gone away. The bottom line: For the year so far, the Facebook stock price has clocked a gain of 42%. To put this into perspective, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is up 12%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gained 22% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has returned 32%.Source: Shutterstock OK then, what can investors now expect with Facebook stock? Has the move been overdone? Or is there still an opportunity here?Well, we may not see the same kind of gains. After all, the markets are looking kind of dicey right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut then again, I still think FB stock will still do relatively well. If anything, it may be a source of stability in a volatile environment.So let's take a look at three key factors for the bull case on Facebook stock: FB Stock - Barriers To EntryWhen Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) evaluates a stock, it looks for a moat. This is a strong barrier to entry against competitors.Facebook actually has multiple moats. They include the main Facebook platform, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. In all, these properties have a staggering 2.38 billion users and 2.1 billion use them on a daily basis.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) The recent privacy issues have shown just how resilient these apps are. For the most part, users have not really cared much. They generally see that the value of Facebook's apps as standout. Keep in mind that in the latest quarter the annual growth rate of the user base was 8%.This is certainly impressive given the scale. What's more, as seen with other social media operators like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), it's no easy feat to grow a user base.So Facebook's moats position the company to keep getting an out-sized portion of the global ad opportunity. FB Stock - GrowthGrowth continues to be robust. In the latest quarter, FB reported that revenues jumped by 26% to $15.1 billion. There was also $6.4 billion in operating earnings (this excludes the $3 billion reserved for a potential payout for a fine to the Federal Trade Commission). And yes, a key driver has been Instagram. According to Kenshoo, the app saw 44% growth in spending in Q1.But there is also a secular trend towards digital advertising. IDC forecasts that the market will go from $229 billion in 2017 to $360 billion by 2021, which is a compound annual growth rate of nearly 11%.To keep up the growth rate, FB has several important levers. These include WhatsApp and Messenger, which are in the early stages of monetization. Facebook also is exploring entering new categories, such as payments (with a focus on a cryptocurrency) and ecommerce, such as with Instagram Checkout and Marketplace.True, these are tough markets to crack. But the company has the big-time advantage of a massive user base and a treasure trove of data. FB Stock - ValuationEven with the run-up in FB, the valuation remains at a reasonable level. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 20X, which represents a discount to the company's growth ramp.Wall Street is also getting more bullish. For example, the average price target is $221.50, which assumes about 18% upside from current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

Moreover, it faces more companies adding a streaming service. Amid these threats, Netflix stock continues its long-term uptrend.Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)So far, Netflix has maintained this lead with new content and market expansion. However, keeping this current pace could hurt holders of Netflix directly. With a heavy debt load, the company may have little choice but to issue more shares, directly undermining the value of NFLX stock.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks)  Transformation and Netflix stockNetflix has become arguably the most transformative company of the last decade. Looking back, some might find it hard to believe that the Justice Department once fretted over the attempt by Blockbuster Video to take over its then-largest competitor, Hollywood Video. Netflix made this irrelevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the last few years, we have also seen consumers increasingly drop pay-TV services in favor of streaming video. The once-loved programming of the major networks only gains scant attention today. Again, we have Netflix to thank.Consequently, valuations in Netflix stock have remained high for several years. Admittedly, I have predicted Netflix's relative decline for a long time, and the market has responded with a higher price for Netflix. For now, content and aggressive international expansion have kept Netflix ahead of its competition. Netflix Stock Isn't ProfitableHowever, I think our own James Brumley points to the real problem that true profitability remains elusive. As he points out, Netflix will reportedly spend $15 billion on content in 2019, up from the $12 billion in outlays for 2018.Interestingly, the company balance sheet states that &quot;cost of revenue&quot; came in at only $9.97 billion for 2018. Content seems like a cost of revenue to me. Regardless, these numbers indicate that if Netflix considered its homegrown material a true cost of revenue, it does not earn a profit.So far, Wall Street has not punished Netflix stock. Moreover, even though I disagree with my colleague Will Ashworth on NFLX, I think he correctly predicts that Disney+ will not lead to widespread cancellations of Netflix service. But the worries extend beyond Disney+. They extend to Disney's Hulu, Prime Video from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which can afford to outspend Netflix on content, and numerous others. Stockholders Will PayNetflix has now resorted to junk bonds to fund its expansion. As a result, it currently holds about $10.3 billion in long-term debt. This has become a heavy burden on a firm with only $5.7 billion in stockholders' equity. When the junk bond market ceases to remain an option, the company will have little choice but to cut content spending or resort to issuing more stock.As it is, NFLX stock trades at about 127 trailing earnings. The equity supports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just over 60. Admittedly, many traders will pay that multiple if the predicted earnings increases of 27.6% this year and 71.3% in 2020 come to pass. However, if the supply of shares proliferates, investor sentiment could cool off.Looking at the charts, one might wonder if it has already cooled off. Since February, Netflix has traded in a narrow range. Time will tell whether this period is a pause before moving higher or an indication of increasing doubts about NFLX.For this reason, I do not recommend a short position. However, with a steadily worsening balance sheet and negative cash flows, I would not own this name at current levels. Final Thoughts on Netflix StockNetflix may soon have to fund its content budget with aggressive share issuance, thereby undermining the stock's value. For most of its history, Netflix has built itself on market disruption.Now, with numerous companies copying its model, it has had to move into new markets and spend heavily on content to stay ahead.However, the cost of this expansion has forced NFLX to issue increasing amounts of junk bonds. With more debt becoming less of an option, Netflix will have to become just another streaming company or dilute its stock. Both options bode poorly for holders of Netflix stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

3579,0.9987,"Just when investors were starting to feel good about their portfolios in 2019 and getting ready to enjoy the summer months, the tide turned for the markets on May 6.  Now, following the rapid declines in the U.S. indices since President Trump's tweets of May 5 regarding the trade war with China, many investors are left wondering whether the decline of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has created a good entry point.Source: Shutterstock However, I would urge investors to not commit all their intended capital to AAPL stock in May. Here is why it is still too soon to invest in Apple stock.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks)  Trade Wars and Apple StockWith a market cap of $896 million, AAPL stock has the second highest weighting in the S&P 500, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  And China is Apple's second-most important market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore AAPL has now become a proxy for the trade wars between the U.S. and China.  In 2018, investors learned that Chinese consumers were starting to turn their backs on AAPL. On Apr. 30, Apple reported second-quarter China sales of $10.2 billion , a year-over-year decline of over 21%.Almost 20% of Apple's revenues come from China.  In 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, sales of iPhones in China have declined. And there's a good possibility that China's economy will slow some more.AAPL has already offered massive price discounts in China in March and April. The company may have to make those price decreases permanent to reach its sales targets. However, retaining those discounts would decrease AAPL's margins and its long-term pricing power, also creating a headwind for Apple stock. Going forward, I do not think we can expect the competitive landscape for the iPhone to improve in China.Furthermore, AAPL relies on Chinese suppliers and its mobile devices are assembled in China. Thus, Apple would have to react to tariffs either by increasing prices in the U.S. or absorbing the cost of the tariffs. The latter action would definitely have a major negative impact on Apple stock price.It is no wonder that, since early 2018, but especially over the past few weeks, the trade dispute has negatively affected the price of Apple stock. The further the signing of the trade deal gets pushed out, the greater the adverse effect on Apple's future earnings and AAPL stock could be. Currency Headwinds and Apple StockI am also somewhat concerned about potential currency fluctuations in the coming weeks. The company's SEC filing clearly identifies the potential negative impact of foreign currency movements on AAPL's earnings. Almost half of Apple's sales come from Pacific Rim countries or Europe, the Middle East and Africa.During 2018, the weakening of foreign currencies, due to rate hikes by the Fed  as well as the overall strength of the U.S. dollar, has translated into lower earnings for Apple. While the equity markets seemed to focus on China in May, it's important to keep an eye on the rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, too.If the Chinese yuan falls further or if investors prefer the safety of the greenback during the escalating rhetoric with Iran, then Apple stock may take another hit. It is worth remembering that Apple pays its Chinese suppliers in U.S. dollars to assemble its products. However, its iPhones are sold to Chinese consumers in yuans. In other words, the dollar's next move could impact Apple's upcoming results, pushing its earnings towards the lower end of the guidance range.If AAPL's sales, margins, and revenue all decline in China amidst increased competition from local companies, including Huawei, and currency headwinds, then the multiple of Apple stock will drop.In May or June, Apple may issue disappointing guidance for the current quarter, causing many investors to hit the sell button first and ask questions later. Has the Good News Been Priced Into AAPL Stock?Even before the concerns over the trade war reignited in early May, much of the positive news on Apple had already been priced into Apple stock.During  its event on Mar. 25, AAPL announced new video, news, gaming subscription services, and a credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). However, despite these potential sources of new revenue, following the event, Apple stock initially declined.Then on Apr. 30, the tech giant posted quarterly revenue of $58 billion, a decline of 5% from the year-ago quarter. Unit sales of iPhones also fell again. Since iPhone revenue accounts for over half of Apple's total revenue, investors pay close attention to iPhone numbers.Yet during the quarter, AAPL exceeded Wall Street's average revenue and earnings estimates, mostly thanks to the strong numbers from Apple Services. The owners of Apple stock who remain committed to AAPL realize the importance of its Services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music, to the company's bottom line in the near-term and the longer term.Following the earnings report, Apple stock initially rallied on May 1,  hitting an intraday high of $215.31. Since then, it has fallen over 12%.Investors would like to see AAPL clearly identify what the company's next growth catalyst will be. In other words, Wall Street would like Apple to find its next big niche. Short-Term Technical Analysis of Apple StockAlthough I firmly believe that Apple stock will perform well in the long-term, on a short-term basis, I expect AAPL stock to be choppy. Over the short-term, investor sentiment and price momentum affect the stock price of a company as closely watched as Apple stock is.AAPL stock is down nearly 3%  over the past 12 months. Right now the technical outlook of Apple stock is rather bearish. The stock price has been making lower highs in the past two weeks. Unless a Chinese trade deal is reached soon, this trend will not change or improve quickly.I believe that Apple stock is likely to reach a 6-month low in late May or early June. If the markets continue to decline, AAPL stock could easily drop to the low $170's or even the high $150's .However, if there is a quick resolution to the trade issues, then AAPL stock will likely rapidly gain 5%-8%. I expect resistance first at $192.5 and then at $200. So Should Investors Buy AAPL Stock?If you believe in the bull case for AAPL stock, and if you do not currently hold any shares, you might consider waiting for a better time to go long, such as $180 or even lower.Year-to-date, AAPL stock is up 16%. Not all investors are comfortable with its increased volatility levels. If you are a shareholder who has been able to ride the impressive rally since early January, then you may want to take some of your profits in Apple stock.Stocks tend to behave differently in a falling market than they do in a rising one. The down moves can be rather fast in a declining market, and a momentum stock like AAPL may become a falling knife. I personally do not like catching falling knives. Therefore, you may consider placing a stop loss at 3%-5% below the current price of Apple stock, to protect your profits to date.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider protecting your portfolio with a covered call. For example, for every 100 shares of AAPL you own around $190, you could sell an AAPL June 21 $190 call option. This approach offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline of AAPL stock. It also enables investors to participate in a potential rally between now and the expiry of the option. The Bottom Line on AAPL StockOver the long haul, robust fundamental numbers are what make a company worth investing in. The longer term outlook of Apple stock is strong, and the company has a clean balance sheet; therefore it remains a long-term play on growth. However, now that earnings season is behind us, the daily performance of Apple stock will depend on macroeconomic news as well as on the action of big day traders until the company reports its results in July. Thus, I do not expect Apple stock to go back over $200 in May, unless a satisfactory trade deal is announced.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3645,0.9433,"After Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its earnings recently, many analysts predicted that Apple's business prospects in China would stabilize. However, America's recent tariff hike and the level of negative rhetoric on both sides are big headwinds for Apple stock. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the last two quarters, Apple has blamed the slowdown of its sales in China on the country's economic weakness. However, it should be noted that  big, Chinese consumer-facing companies like Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) have reported that their core businesses .are growing over 40%. This means that the decline of Apple's revenue in China is due to company-specific issues.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal  Increasing the Stake for Apple StockIn recent tweets, President Trump has ramped up his  rhetoric on trade. At the current junction, it's difficult for either side to back down. This means that a successful resolution to negotiations in the near- term is unlikely.Those who plan to hold Apple stock over the long-term should also focus on future trends developing within China. The recent tariff hike and rhetoric reduce the probability of an amicable trade deal. Even if a mutually acceptable trade deal is reached, the trade rhetoric of the past few months will have a negative impact on Apple's business and brand within China and, by extension, on Apple stock. The Chinese government wants local Chinese brands to increase their market shares at Apple's expense. For its second quarter which ended in March, Apple reported $10.2 billion of net sales from the Greater China region. That's a decline of 22% from the same period a year earlier.Last year, Apple generated $51.9 billion of revenue from China, equating to 20% of its total sales. After two quarters of fiscal 2019, it's clear that its China sales will easily decline by 20%-25% for the full year. That will have a big negative impact on Apple stock. Lack of Ecosystem in ChinaApple's biggest strength has been its strong ecosystem which increases the loyalty towards its products. However, in China, its ecosystem is weaker than in western markets. The main reason for that is the impact of Tencent's (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) WeChat, which provides almost all the services required by customers, including payments, communications, music, games, e-commerce and more. Late last year, Tencent announced that its mini-programs have one million apps and over 200 million daily active users. These mini-programs reduce the need to visit Apple's App Store. WeChat's platform will continue to grow stronger, adversely impacting Apple's ecosystem within China. Apple has been trying to improve the popularity of its Apple Pay within China for a number of years. However, AAPL has found it difficult to overcome the duopoly of Tencent's Wepay and Alibaba's Alipay. Last year, Apple started accepting Alipay within its retail stores., showing the massive hurdle faced by Apple in this area. The current trade tensions make its weaker ecosystem in China more crucial. Company-Specific ProblemIn the last two earnings report, Apple's management has hinted that its poor sales in China are due to the slowdown of the economy. China's  GDP growth has certainly dropped slightly in the last few quarters. But there has not been a massive decline in consumer demand. Apple reported a 22% decline in its net sales in China in its March quarter and another 26% in the previous quarter. On the other hand, Alibaba reported 40% growth in its core commerce sales last quarter. As a result, the decline in Apple's China sales seems to be a largely company-specific issue.Source: IDCIn its recent report, IDC has estimated that Apple's unit shipments in its March quarter declined by a whopping 30.2%. At the same time, China's Huawei has shown over 50% growth. Most of the growth of Huawei has been in the domestic Chinese market. Huawei has been aggressively promoting its products and providing deep discounts. That has forced Apple to reduce its own prices. In the last few weeks of the March quarter, Apple gave massive discounts on the newer iPhones in China. The discounts on the iPhone XS Max were as high as 2000 Yuan (around $300).  A Perfect Storm in ChinaThe recent jump in Apple stock after the earnings shows that Wall Street is ready to give Apple a pass for poor sales in Greater China. But the company can experience  a perfect storm as a number of negative factors impact its business in China. Apple stock has been hurt when there were tensions between U.S. and China in the past. Even if a deal is made, the Chinese government can hit Apple with regulatory hurdles, hurting Apple stock. It would be nearly impossible for Apple to replicate in China the services it has launched in the U.S. There are already major domestic tech players in China which provide news, music, video, payments, and communication services. The revenue base of Apple's App Store can be further eroded due to the growth of WeChat's ecosystem.Finally, Huawei has a big home team advantage in China. It will also be launching 5G services sooner than Apple. It would be difficult for Apple to rely solely on its brand image to counter Huawei. The recent price cuts by Apple in China are a sign of the company's lower pricing power in this region. All these factors will continue to hurt Apple's net sales in China for the next few quarters, reducing the extent of any bullish runs by Apple stock. The Bottom Line on AAPL StockThe Greater China region contributed close to 20% of the total revenue of Apple in its last fiscal year. In the last two quarters, Apple has reported year-over-year declines of 26% and 22%, respectively, in net sales from this region. AAPL could experience further deterioration in China, depending on the result of the trade negotiations and the growth of its local rivals. It would be difficult for Apple to replace this lost revenue .It should be noted that the 22% decline in net sales in the Greater China region came despite heavy discounts offered by Apple in March. The near-term movement of Apple stock will heavily depend on its ability to generate decent results in China.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any companies named.

With BRK.B down about 6% so far this month, any further pullbacks in the coming weeks would be a sign to investors to consider buying into the shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Value Investing Makes BRK.B Stock a Long-Term BuyCountless articles and experts praise Berkshire Hathaway's performance over the past six decades and Mr. Buffett's amazing value investing prowess. Indeed, the effect of compounded gains for long-term BRK.B shareholders is tremendous. The 10-year gain tops 187% versus a 161% increase in the S&P 500 index.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites Throughout his investment career, Warren Buffet, his partner Charlie Munger, and their investment team have purchased businesses with sustainable competitive advantages, or &quot;moats,&quot; preferably at discounted prices, with the aim of generating long-term value.One other point to note is that Berkshire Hathaway has mostly favored free cash flow (FCF) rich business models. FCF is a powerful metric to analyze the true profitability of a business. It shows if the business is run efficiently to generate enough cash to pay its investors a return.So far, their strategy has worked extremely well. An initial investment of $1,000 in BRK.A stock in 1962 would have become over $16 million today. (The more-modestly priced BRK.B stock came about in a 1996 split.) Although past returns are no indication or guarantee of future returns, I believe that investors can still expect Berkshire Hathaway management to continue to invest in companies that will deliver growth over the long-term. BRK.B Stock's Cash PileMost long-term investors do not want to be constantly thinking about the fundamental strength of the stocks in their portfolios. A robust balance sheet is what has attracted investors to Berkshire Hathaway over the decades.On May 4, BRK.B reported strong first-quarter 2019 earnings that, as always, coincided with the annual meeting, a truly big event for shareholders. Analysts and investors alike also look forward to reading Buffet's annual letter released for the meeting.At the end Q1, Berkshire had about $114 billion in cash. This cash pile has expanded in part due to Berkshire's highly profitable businesses and in part due to the lack of meaningful acquisitions until recently. Investors care a lot about FCF, as it can be used in a discretionary manner. The power of the amount of cash on hand is one of the reasons that the BRK.B stock is so unique. Berkshire Hathaway and Stock PurchasesBuffet authorizes two types of stock purchases: the companies Berkshire Hathaway buys for its own portfolio and BRK.B stock repurchases. Let us look at each to see how either one may create value for shareholders.Purchasing Other Companies: Berkshire Hathaway either buys out entire companies or invests substantial sums of money in other publicly traded companies through common stock purchases. Its portfolio, which covers a wide range of sectors, is not quite like any other publicly traded firm.In general, management does not volunteer any more information on this portfolio than is legally required. Some analysts see the investment giant's stock-picking strategies as its trade secret. Whenever BRK.B announces a new position in a company, the shares of that company shoot up as investors feel Buffet has found value in the price of the stock.Currently, we know that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest holding of BRK.B, occupies over 20% of the portfolio. Second in line is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), followed by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).The company has recently acquired shares in the Brazilian fintech company, StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) as well as a stake in the parent company of India's largest mobile-payments service, Paytm. Buffet also announced that BRK.B now holds shares in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wall Street has seen these acquisitions as BRK.B's progressive moves to capitalize on high growth trends, including emerging markets. It is possible that, in an attempt to create growth, the company's investing approach could change in the future.Going forward, BRK.B has an enviable amount of cash on hand to finance more potential acquisitions to fuel the growth of the stock. And management will likely be constantly looking for promising opportunities.Repurchasing BRK.B Stock: Long-term followers of Buffett's value investment strategy know that he regards share repurchases as a good way for companies to reward shareholders. Companies then reduce the number of outstanding shares and each shareholder ends up holding a larger piece of the company. He last bought BRK.B stock in the first quarter of 2019.In 2018, the company said that management would authorize share repurchases when it believed that the repurchase price would be &quot;below Berkshire's intrinsic value.&quot; Previously, Buffet has relied on a book value multiple of 1.2x when deciding if it may be an appropriate time to buy back shares.In case of further declines in BRK.B stock price, I'd expect management to consider another stock repurchase program, which would act as a support level for the stock price. Whenever Berkshire Hathaway has bought back its shares in the past, the market has applauded the move and BRK.B stock price has gone up. Could BRK.B Stock Finally Pay Dividends?Warren Buffett -- AKA &quot;The Oracle of Omaha&quot; -- is never shy to let investors know how much he loves to invest in stocks that pay dividend income. Yet, he has also made it clear that he does not intend for BRK.B stock to pay dividends.However, many BRK.B shareholders would like to see the group pay dividends, partly because Berkshire Hathaway has so much cash available.In the past, Buffet has argued that management would be able to reinvest that money better than most shareholders. Nonetheless, he has recently admitted that good investment ideas are not easy to find any more.Therefore, the investing legend may indeed have a change of heart soon. Then there could be an upcoming shareholder letter telling investors that the company would pay dividends. And that is likely to be good for the stock price. Short-Term Technical Analysis Shows HeadwindsMany stocks may continue to be volatile in May, and I would not advocate trying to identify stocks that could be immune to a U.S.-China trade war.As a result of the strong run-up in BRK.B stock price earlier in 2019, its short-term technical indicators had become somewhat &quot;overbought,&quot; until last week. However, in less than two weeks, BRK.B stock price is down almost 9%.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk Yet if Berkshire Hathaway stock price declines further, long-term investors may find it particularly attractive. I believe BRK.B stock price is likely to find major support between $195 and $200. At that point, I'd expect BRK.B stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until its next earnings report in late July.If you aren't already long BRK.B stock, you may want to remain on the sidelines and wait for a pullback. I'd also consider buying covered calls in conjunction with going long on Berkshire Hathaway stock. Investor Takeaway on Berkshire Hathaway stockIn many ways, there will never be another company like Berkshire Hathaway and many analysts agree that, in the future, the group may not be able repeat its stellar past performance. Yet, the strength of the balance sheet coupled with management's proactive approach, which is firmly grounded in the value investing tradition, will likely enable BRK.B to buy into companies that will fuel its growth. Therefore, despite any potential short-term price weakness, BRK.B stock belongs to a diversified portfolio.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3741,-0.7764,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has taken a pounding this month, dropping 10.3 percent since May 1. Much of the financial media attention related to Apple's weakness is focused on the trade war. Ramping trade tensions are certainly an overhang for Apple stock price in the near-term. Unfortunately, the biggest long-term risk for Apple this week came from the U.S. Supreme Court.Source: Shutterstock On Monday, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to allow an iPhone user antitrust lawsuit to proceed. The heart of the issue is the 30% sales commission Apple charges third-party apps for sales in Apple's App Store.The lawsuit alleges that Apple's dominant share of the smartphone market violates antitrust laws and gives them non-competitive pricing power. As a result, Apple gouges app developers, which are forced to raise prices for consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market  Apple Stock and the ComplaintApp developers and iPhone users have criticized Apple's App Store practices for years. In March, Streaming music leader Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) filed a complaint with the European Commission alleging similar app store abuses.Spotify and other developers say Apple deliberately promotes its own applications at the expense of third-party developers. Third-party developers like Spotify must agree to Apple's terms to sell their apps in Apple's App Store.By taking a 30 percent cut of third-party developers' sales, developers claim Apple is deliberately inflating its competitors' prices. At the same time, Apple does not allow third-party apps to access Apple hardware.Apple also does not allow developers to communicate directly with customers about deals or promotions. Spotify said it was ultimately forced to remove its premium subscription service from the App Store completely.For years, the general bull thesis hinged directly on iPhone unit sales growth. Today, that narrative has shifted from selling more iPhones to better monetizing existing iPhone customers.The core of that thesis is that it's fine for iPhone sales to plateau as long as Apple can hold onto its existing iPhone customers. Apple can sell higher-priced iPhones to customers looking to renew their hardware, and it can grow revenue by selling more services.The App Store is at the center of Apple's high-growth Services segment. In the second quarter, Apple Services revenue hit a record $11.5 billion. It's still a relatively modest number compared to iPhone sales. However, while iPhone sales were down 17%, Services revenue was up 16.6%.Apple's 390 million paid customer subscriptions is up 30% from a year ago. Management has said it wants to push that number to 500 million by 2020. It is also targeting $14 billion in Services segment revenue by 2020.In a nutshell, the iPhone is approaching a global saturation point, and Services to pick up the slack if Apple stock is going to grow again. If regulators find Apple is guilty of non-competitive practices in its App Store, it could take a major bite out of Services revenue growth and margins. It could also result in some stiff legal penalties and potential fines. The Bottom Line on Apple StockI see regulators as the biggest threat to Apple in the long-term, but China is also a problem. According to Sensor Tower, Apple App Store revenue is expected to more than double over the next five years and hit $96 billion by fiscal 2023. Not surprisingly, Sensor Tower said China will be the single largest growth source for App Store spending.Bank of America estimates China accounted for about 28% of App Store revenue in fiscal 2019, even more than the U.S. at 27%.Apple is more than just an American company that does business in China. It's the most valuable American company and a symbol of American technology. Apple management said earlier this year that trade war uncertainty is already impacting its business. However, the biggest threat could come if China decides to single out Apple to make a point.At the end of the day, I believe a trade deal is coming sooner rather than later given the trade war is hurting both the U.S. and China. However, if regulators crack down on Apple and force more lenient App Store terms, the impact on Apple's bottom line could be significant and lasting.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

At Microsoft's Build event this year, it spent a significant amount of time touting Azure. It also talked about its Windows operating system and its Surface tablet hardware.MSFT's comments about Azure  suggest the unit's profit margins will rise going forward. Cloud services and software solutions typically are more profitable than hardware products. So, if Microsoft can meaningfully raise Azure's market share from its current 13.7% level, the company's profits could increase significantly, boosting Microsoft stock in the process. Azure's Compelling FeaturesAzure is a true hybrid, hyper-scale cloud solution. Customers get a consistent development environment, whether or not they are connected to the public cloud. Azure Stack extends that hybrid differentiation to allow customers to build and run cloud applications at the edge of their networks. And this feature, unlike VMWare 's(NYSE: VMW) offering, allows customers to build and run virtualized applications on-premise.Moreover, Microsoft expanded the IT security capabilities of Azure by offering Azure Sentinel, which analyzes security signals across the entire organization. The solution uses artificial intelligence to detect, investigate, and respond rapidly to threats. Azure's GrowthIn MSFT's fiscal third quarter, an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts helped MSFT grow its bookings by 20% year-over-year. The company's Commercial Cloud revenue jumped 41% YoY to more than $9.6 billion.Azure's revenue grew 73%, driven by strong growth in its consumption-based business across all of its customer segments. The Outlook of AzureMSFT forecast that the  gross margin of its commercial cloud business would continue to be high. However, that could be offset slightly by a higher mix of IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) and PaaS (platform-as-a-service).One thing is certain: MSFT is making positive changes to both the hardware and software used by Azure. As a result, more customers will use premium Azure services, pushing Azure's gross margin higher and providing a positive catalyst to Microsoft stock. Valuation and the Bottom Line on MSFT StockBoth Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA)  and MSFT compete with Amazon.com's AWS, but neither BABA nor Microsoft stock has a similar valuation to AMZN stock. In relative terms, BABA and MSFT stock trade at significantly lower price-earnings multiples than Amazon.com.Even though markets value Microsoft's Azure at a discount, that may change. And when Azure's revenue becomes the biggest part of Microsoft's business,Microsoft stock is sure to trade at or above the $1 trillion level. With Azure growing so fast, that could happen very soon.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company has dealt with chip delays, a resurgent Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the failure of its 5G mobile modem efforts -- losing its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone business as part of that -- and the Spectre and Meltdown crisis that kicked off 2018.Source: Graz University of Technology Now Intel is in the spotlight once again, and not in a good way. A new vulnerability in PC processors called &quot;ZombieLoad&quot; has been identified by security researchers. It could allow hackers to gain access to sensitive information, including passwords and it appears that virtually every Intel CPU since 2011 is affected. The company has released yet another patch, but PCs take a performance hit from installing it.There was little impact on Intel stock after the news of ZombieLoad broke on Tuesday, but AMD stock popped by over 4%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ZombieLoad Comes for Intel ProcessorsGoing back to January 2018, Intel was hit hard by the discovery of Meltdown and Spectre. These vulnerabilities -- which also affected AMD and ARM-based processors -- posed a huge security risk to PC users. There was potential for hackers to exploit the vulnerabilities to steal critical data. PCs were affected, but so were cloud servers and even mobile devices.Intel must be feeling a sense of deja-vu, because once again, a critical vulnerability has been announced that affects its processors.   * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week TechCrunch announced on Tuesday that security researchers from Graz University of Technology have discovered a new critical vulnerability in Intel chips called ZombieLoad. This vulnerability is similar to Meltdown and Spectre in that it could allow a hacker to steal data directly from the processor. The security research team that discovered ZombieLoad describes it like this:&quot;While programs normally only see their own data, a malicious program can exploit the fill buffers to get hold of secrets currently processed by other running programs. These secrets can be user-level secrets, such as browser history, website content, user keys, and passwords, or system-level secrets, such as disk encryption keys.&quot;Like Meltdown and Spectre, ZombieLoad affects not only consumer and business PCs, but also the servers used in cloud computing. That means a big headache for companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). What's different this time around is that the vulnerability appears to be unique to Intel chips. According to the researchers, ZombieLoad affects most Intel CPUs released since 2011, but not processors from AMD, or ARM-based chips.  Intel has already released patches (the company was warned by the researchers prior to the findings being published), but those come with a cost. An Intel spokesperson told TechCrunch that patched PCs could take a performance hit of up to 3%, while cloud servers could see their performance drop by as much as 9%. An Opportunity for AMDGiven the news that hit INTC, the 4.1% pop in AMD stock makes sense. AMD has been on a tear, even as Intel has struggled. With the release of its Ryzen PC processors, AMD has begun to eat into Intel's PC market share, going from 17.5% of PC processors in 2016 to a current 22.8% share. The company beat Intel to the new 7nm chip architecture, and late last year, AMD inked a deal with AMZN to have its new EPYC chips used in Amazon web servers.With Amazon and other cloud service providers staring down yet another performance hit on their Intel-based servers after the ZombieLoad patch, you can bet that AMD is pushing those EPYC chips even harder. The bad PR Intel is receiving from ZombieLoad is likely to pay off for AMD when it comes to its Ryzen chips in the PC market as well. Overall, this latest vulnerability is just the latest bad news to hit INTC, but it's yet another opportunity for Advanced Micro Devices to build market share and for AMD stock to grow in value.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

So far, the return on Nokia stock price is a miserable -17%, despite a strong bull move in the tech space.Source: Shutterstock But there is nothing new about this. Let's face it, Nokia stock has not had much traction for quite a while. Note that the average return for the past decade is -5.81%.Despite all this, might there still be a contrarian play here? Maybe the company's strategy is the right one?  Hey, after all, we've seen slumbering tech gains like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) find ways to renew their businesses.  And this has resulted in substantial gains for shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Forever Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains So, could there potentially be something similar with NOK stock? Granted, this may seem kind of laughable right now. The company has shown lapses in execution, as witnessed in its latest earnings report. Nokia posted a loss of 2 cents a share and revenues of $4.49 billion, while the Street was looking for a profit of 2 cents a share and revenues of $5.06 billion.But when it comes to transforming a company, the progress can be choppy. Competition remains tough and there are long sales cycles.However, NOK is still a much better company today, as it has done much of the needed heavy-lifting of cost cutting and restructuring to streamline operations. There have also been some major acquisitions, such as for Alcatel-Lucent.Yet, the most important potential catalyst is the emergence of 5G. As an indication of the importance of this trend, look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It appears that the key reason it settled its massive lawsuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was to ensure that the company has the necessary technology for 5G. This technology is a must-have.While mobile network transitions do not necessarily result in major demand for equipment, this time is likely to be different. Speeds for 5G are likely to be 100 times faster than 4G, which means there will probably be a surge in innovation. And this means more than just greatly improving smartphones. There will also be opportunities in categories like IoT (Internet-of-Things), gaming, education, autonomous cars and so on.To play in this market, there needs to be secure, reliable and scalable technology. And yes, NOK is one of a few companies that that has these capabilities with its systems.Another important factor: The US-China trade standoff. This means that the US will block out a fierce competitor -- mainly, China's Huawei.And finally, Nokia has a valuable patent portfolio. On the earnings call, CEO Rajeev Suri remarked that there will be continued strength from the portfolio that should provide &quot;considerable monetization opportunities.&quot; Bottom Line on NOK StockThe move to 5G has certainly not been without its challenges  -- and this should be no surprise. The technology is complicated and requires dealing with onerous rules and requirements. But as for NOK, management is still optimistic and believes that the second half of the year will see a pick-up in the business. There is also about 200 million in euros of revenues that are expected to be recognized during this period of time.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Something else: NOK stock is quite cheap at current levels, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 12 or so. Oh, and the dividend yield is an attractive 4.13%. This is among one of the highest in the tech sector.In other words, NOK stock does look like an interesting value play on the 5G opportunity.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

3792,0.9074,"The case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reasonably simple. Yes, Apple stock looks reasonably cheap. But given that earnings are potentially at a peak, AAPL shares should be cheap. Not only that, it can still get even cheaper.Source: Shutterstock It's a case I've made for some time now. The iPhone over the past four quarters has generated 58% of total revenue. Yet sales may well have peaked. Per the 10-Q, iPhone revenue already has fallen nearly 16% year-over-year in the first half of fiscal 2019.That's unlikely to change. The U.S. market is saturated, and replacement cycles are extending. Apple is not going to be able to institute the same pricing increases that drove revenue growth in recent years. And as is the case with all consumer hardware, whether it's TVs or PCs, the gap between iPhones and lower-cost Android alternatives inevitably will narrow over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bullish response is that even if iPhone sales drop, its Services business -- including the profitable App Store -- and growth in China can keep earnings stable at worst. With the AAPL stock price only about 15 times FY19 earnings estimates plus its cash hoard, that should be good enough.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk However, that bull case has taken a clear hit recently. And while Apple stock has moved in response, falling almost 10% since a pop after Q2 earnings, it hasn't moved far enough. Thus, AAPL stock can get a lot cheaper from here. The Services Problem for the Apple Stock PriceThe argument for Apple stock is that the underlying company can pivot from hardware to services. Certainly, management can leverage its enormous installed-user base to accomplish this transition. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note this week indicated that his firm valued the Services business between $400 billion and $450 billion. Many other investors and analysts see Services as driving the next phase of Apple's growth.To be fair, there are reasons for optimism toward the business. Apple doesn't break out operating margins but they're no doubt enormous. The company takes a piece out of the overall transaction for offerings like iTunes, the App Store, and Apple Music. It does this at little cost.In fact, we know that margins are strong because some of Apple's customers are rebelling. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) cut off in-app subscriptions in an effort to get around the 30% &quot;Apple tax&quot;. It hasn't been the only company to look at ways around the App Store.But now, the Services business faces a real risk. The Supreme Court this week allowed a lawsuit against Apple to proceed. That suit alleges that the App Store acts as a monopoly toward Apple users. Because developers raise prices to account for Apple's 30% fees, consumers are theoretically harmed.The suit hasn't been won, and will take years to play out. But Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) has filed a complaint with the European Commission on similar grounds. And other big companies may follow Netflix's lead.Services growth isn't going to stall out instantly. But with analysts like Wedbush assigning a 10x revenue multiple to the business, it's an enormous part of the bull case here. An already tricky situation got even riskier with the Supreme Court decision. China Conflict Weighs on AAPLSuddenly, the recently escalating trade war raises another problem for the Apple stock price. The company is enormously reliant on China for its production. That's even more true given that the hyped entrance of its supplier Foxconn Technology Group into Wisconsin has proven to be something close to a fraud.Wedbush, which has an AAPL stock price target of $240, estimated the impact of the new tariffs. They forecast a hit of 50 cents for earnings per share in a base scenario. That ramps up to $1-plus if Apple can't or won't pass the costs on to consumers. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) appears to see a similar effect. Another view sees Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) modeling a worst-case scenario hit of $3 per share.But this isn't just a cost problem. Again, Chinese growth is a big part of the bull thesis here. Wedbush noted that roughly 20% of pending upgrades come from Greater China. Chinese state-owned media is unlikely to help the company maintain those sales and neither are Chinese consumers.The problem -- the Q2 report's perhaps most underappreciated aspect -- is that sales in the region already are plunging. Revenue in Greater China fell over 21% year-over-year in Q2. Operating income dropped more than 27%. That comes after a somewhat promising rebound in fiscal 2018. And it undercuts yet another leg of the bull thesis for AAPL stock. Could the AAPL Stock Price Head to $150?In Wedbush's bull model, Services account for over 40% of the valuation of Apple's business. Greater China on the whole accounts for 20% of total operating income.Both aspects of the business have taken a big hit just in recent days. And that comes after a Q1 report that, while initially well-received, didn't seem to help the bull case much to begin with. Indeed, the Apple stock price gave back the post-earnings gains relatively quickly, even before the external news this week. Services revenue was essentially in line with expectations and the drop in China was much greater than modeled.It's hard to see the last two weeks as doing anything other than providing a significant hit to the bull case for AAPL. And while 14x earnings plus cash might seem cheap, it's not cheap if earnings are peaking. Sales performance of iPhones still suggests that's likely at least in the near term. EPS is expected to decline this year even with substantial help from share repurchases.In the long term, China and Services are supposed to drive earnings to new heights. Investors can't ignore the fact that news this week undercuts that thesis. And it in turn suggests a valuation closer to 10x to 12x EPS plus cash. That gets the Apple stock price under $150, and back to December/January lows.Fundamentally, there are real problems here. And if the trade war continues, and Services optimism moderates, the growth narrative starts to crumble. This is a worrisome week for Apple stock, and it could signal more trouble to come.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

3793,-0.9846,"Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's ruling, allowing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to proceed. The Supreme Court's decision means consumers can proceed with a lawsuit that claims the App Store is a monopoly, and Apple's 30% cut of app fees results in inflated prices. Adding to AAPL's woes, the trade war with China is escalating, and this time Apple products are in the crosshairs. The market reaction to the Supreme Court ruling and the renewed threat of the trade war with China was swift: Apple stock dropped nearly 6% by close.Source: Apple With iPhone sales slumping, Apple has increasingly focused on its Services division for revenue growth. In its latest quarterly earnings, AAPL reported Services revenue hit a new all-time high of $11 billion. Services include Apple Music, Apple Pay and others, but the App Store is a big part of that.Apple announced in January that in the few days between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, customers had spent $1.22 billion on App Store purchases. Since 2008, they have spent $120 billion. And Apple takes a 30% cut of those sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market That's the focus of a lawsuit that has been filed against the company. The claim is that the App Store is a monopoly, since Apple prevents iPhone and iPad users from downloading apps from anywhere else. Therefore, the 30% cut Apple takes results in consumers paying inflated prices for apps. The lawsuit has been ongoing for nearly a decade, but on Monday the Supreme Court ruled that it can proceed. Should Apple ultimately lose the case, that would likely mean big penalties in addition to that 30% cut being in jeopardy.Having the Supreme Court rule against AAPL and allow the lawsuit to continue was enough to spook investors, and hit Apple stock.  Trouble In and With ChinaApple's Monday didn't stop with the App Store lawsuit headache. It got worse. The trade war between China and the U.S. has been escalating in recent days. On Monday, China announced it will raise tariffs on some U.S. products in retaliation for President Trump's threats last week to increase the tariffs on Chinese imports. AAPL is truly caught in the middle of this fight. The company's most important product -- the iPhone -- is primarily assembled in China. And Apple also sells products in China. In Q2, the Chinese market accounted for 17.6% of AAPL revenue.In the early stages of the trade war between China and the U.S., Apple escaped relatively unscathed. The worsening conditions mean that AAPL could be hit on two fronts. Chinese consumers could buy fewer Apple products, and at the same time, tariffs could begin to hit Apple in America. A Morgan Stanley analyst calculated that new tariffs could add $160 to the price of the iPhone XS … or force AAPL to eat that additional cost, significantly cutting into earnings.Unless cooler heads prevail, the trade war with China is nothing but downside for Apple stock. App Store Lawsuit + China = Big Trouble for Apple StockWhile the Supreme Court ruling isn't an actual verdict and there's a good chance that AAPL will still win the case, the potential to trip up Services revenue is worrying to investors. News that the U.S. trade war with China is escalating and that AAPL may not avoid getting caught in the crossfire this time is also cause for concern. Combined, the two factors resulted in a very bad Monday for AAPL investors with a 5.81% loss on the day for Apple stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Berkshire Hathaway stock has been hit but is holding up near its support, making it worth examining. Not to mention, it's Warren Buffett's company.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market In a way, BRK.B stock is a holding company, given its massive equity portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway stock sports a market cap of $500 billion and has an equity portfolio worth roughly $200 billion. BRK.B also has a large portfolio of privately-owned companies, such as Geico, Dairy Queen, Burlington Northern, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Precision Castparts and See's Candies, among many others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the public equity side, its largest position is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is more than double its next biggest position,  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). BRK.B also owns stakes in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and a number of others. Valuing Berkshire Hathaway StockBecause Berkshire is now forced to report its earnings using a mark-to-market accounting method,  the company can show huge losses or gains in any given quarter. Its earnings fluctuate primarily based on the performance of its stock holdings. As one can imagine, Berkshire's earnings have become quite volatile.BRK.B is expected to earn $10.30 per share of Berkshire Hathaway stock this year, up 2.6% from the prior year. BRK.B stock is currently trading at about 20 times analysts' consensus 2019 EPS estimate, which isn't a bad premium for the Oracle of Omaha's business. But that doesn't really tell the whole story, partly because of the way that Berkshire has to report its gains now.Berkshire Hathaway stock won't provide the growth of a high-octane cloud start-up, but it's a well-managed and disciplined firm that knows a good company when it sees one. Interestingly, BRK.B has a unique type of &quot;cash problem&quot; now. Berkshire held $114 billion in cash and short-term securities as of its most recent quarter. However, it can't find enough good deals out there in which to invest.But BRK.B has a ton of cash and so the company has understandably turned to buying back a decent amount of Berkshire stock. BRK.B stock worth $10 billion helped finance  the deal between Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Berkshire received a great return in exchange for those shares, but Berkshire still has plenty of money in the vault.Since Berkshire is such a well-run and well-financed company, buying Berkshire Hathaway stock sure isn't the worst investment on the block. Trading BRK.B StockIf BRK.B stock corrects,, longer term buyers may have a good opportunity. Berkshire Hathaway stock has bounced off the $197-$198 area multiple times in the past year. It will hopefully do so again if the shares reach that level again. Also worth pointing out is that the 100-week moving average of BRK.B stock stands at $198, while the 50-week is at $204, near its current levels.The fact that Berkshire Hathaway stock has dropped slightly below $204 isn't a bad development, either, particularly for long-term investors.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

4072,0.9609,"A finance professor made a startling discovery about the stock market: Over a 90-year span, 96% of all stocks collectively performed no better than risk-free 1-month Treasury bills. After analyzing the lifetime returns of 25,967 common stocks, Hendrik Bessembinder determined that just 1,092 of those stocks -- or about 4% of the total -- generated all of the $34.8 trillion in wealth created for shareholders by the stock market between July 1926 and December 2016. Even more striking, a mere 50 stocks accounted for well over one-third (39.3%) of that amount.But before we get to our profiles of the 50 best-performing stocks of all time, many of which are (or were) components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a word of caution. Accurately identifying the precious few &quot;home run&quot; stocks amid the many thousands of underachieving names is extremely difficult. It might be impossible. Your portfolio is more likely to suffer because you guessed wrong and failed to invest in the top long-term winners, says Bessembinder of Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business.

4073,-0.965,"Tech stocks among most U.S. equities are getting hammered on Friday as the U.S.-China trade talks ended in acrimony, with the President Donald Trump administration pushing ahead with higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The tariff rate will increase from 10% to 25%. Additionally, Trump announced they are starting the process of slapping another 25% tariff on the remaining $320 billion of Chinese imports thus far not affected by the trade standoff.China, for its part, has vowed to take retaliatory measures.This is pretty much the worst-case scenario, coming after months of hinting and teasing in the press that a deal was forthcoming. Tech stocks in particular are looking vulnerable here, as they are highly sensitive to global supply chain linkages. Higher tariffs will directly eat into profitability margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days As a result, the group is slumping. Here are five tech stocks to sell now: Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which loves to tout that its products are &quot;Designed in California,&quot; has thus far avoided being impacted by the Chinese import tariffs Trump has enacted, as the product codes for its iPhone and Airpods and other devices have been left out of the regulatory changes. But with Trump threatening to tariff all products, the company will soon no longer be able to skirt higher customs costs.Investors are dumping shares in response, and AAPL stock is threatening to fall below its 50-day moving average for the first time since October. Watch for a possible decline down to the February-March lows, which would be a worth a decline of roughly 13% from here. The company will likely next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.11 per share on revenues of $53.5 billion. Alphabet (GOOG)Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have pulled back violently from a recent push to record highs, collapsing below their 50-day moving average and closing in on the 200-day average. This after the tech stock reported a surprise revenue miss late last month, posting the slowest growth in four years as ad pricing came under pressure.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From This is a bigger deal than it seems at first, since so much of the technology ecosystem depends on display and text ad pricing. Prior to this, the company last reported on Feb. 4, with earnings of $10.95 beating estimates by four cents on a 16.7% rise in revenues. Micron Technology (MU)Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares are falling below both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, threatening to break the March-low support and return to the lows not seen since December. Such a move would be worth a loss of more than 25% from here. The tech stock's China segment revenue is at risk from deepening trade tensions and a possible nationalist blowback against Apple products in China, which Micron supplies components for.The company is scheduled to next report results on June 19 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 85 cents per share on revenues of $4.8 billion. When the company last reported on March 20, earnings of $1.71 beat estimates by five cents on a 20.6% decline in revenues. Snap (SNAP)While Uber (NYSE:UBER) is getting all the IPO attention these days, 2017 IPO Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is coming under pressure as the social media darling continues to struggle after an ill-reviewed Snapchat redesign and an odd move to relabel itself a &quot;camera company&quot; with its Spectacles wearable device (which are horribly ugly, by the way).Shares have dropped back below their 50-day moving average and are exiting a three-month consolidation range. Watch for a drop back to the 200-day moving average, which would be worth a loss of more than 14% from here.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close. Analysts are looking for a loss of 10 cents per share on revenues of $356.5 million. When the company last reported on April 23, a loss of 10 cents per share beat estimates by two cents on a 38.9% rise in revenues. Alibaba (BABA)Speaking of Uber, it is the largest IPO by market cap after eclipsing Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Shares are drifting lower on worries about the domestic Chinese economy in the wake of higher U.S. tariffs. Shares are threatening to fall out of a four-month consolidation range, setting up a retest of the October-December lows. Not exactly what KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts expected when they raised their price target to $240 back on May 7.The company will next report results on May 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 98 cents per share on revenues of $13.4 billion.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any fo the aforementioned securities.

4081,0.9987,"Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is a Canadian company that launched in 1998 and has taken North America by storm. And in this case, it's a huge swath of American women, who have built the new althleisure movement.Source: Shutterstock Traditionally, most athletic wear was usually built for function more than form. But that started to change in the 1980s. Whether it was hip-hop stars, Russian mobsters or stay at home moms, it seemed everyone was adopting warm-up suits as a form of leisurewear.LULU took it to the next level. As the Gen Xers started to get older, their idea of an active lifestyle left the tennis court or aerobics class and was branching out into spinning and yoga. And these new activities called for a rethinking of athletic wear, something that you would be supportive in the gym but also attractive and comfortable outside it. And new fabric technology changed the baggy tracksuit into a form-fitting sheath.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLULU also began to make this new &quot;athleisure&quot; wear more feminine as well. And this was what really started to separate it from the mass market products around.  * 10 Stocks That Could Squeeze Short Sellers, Including CGC And that niche has belonged to LULU ever since. What's more, because it was less available and higher quality, there was an inherent mystique about it that continues to this day. It's like the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of athleisure.Nowhere is that more obvious than LULU stock. Its July 2007 debut had the stock in the low teens. It doubled by late 2010. Now the stock is trading around $174. In the past 12 months, LULU stock is up 77% and my Portfolio Grader still rates it an A -- a strong buy.What's more, even with that kind of outsized growth, Lululemon stock is still trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 48. That's pretty impressive. Usually a company with this kind of growth, market dominance and name recognition would be at a P/E far above its growth rate. The Truth Behind LULU Stock's GrowthOne thing that has kept LULU stock and company on this growth trajectory is the fact that it only sells direct to consumer, either online or in its stores. This gives it generous margins, allows it to sell higher quality products and keeps its pricing where it needs to be to keep those margins strong.Recently LULU has announced that it's introducing an annual membership model, launching a line for men and children, and most recently announced that it's going to start making its own shoes.Select stores sold a line of APL shoes since 2017, but now it seems that LULU is serious about selling its own branded shoes. It also expects to double revenue from its men's line as well as boost its ecommerce sales, sooner rather than later.As long as the economy continues to expand, LULU is in a great place. Many younger men and women are more interested in quality over quantity, so a couple of pairs of Lululemon products are preferable to a closet or drawer full of lower priced, lesser quality products.And given its high-end branding, LULU is going to give the bigger players like Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour (NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) a run for their money.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

4101,0.9987,"Earlier this week, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division kicked off its annual developer conference, Google I/O 2019. While the new affordable Pixel 3a smartphones got much of the spotlight, the company also announced big changes with Nest, which is now called Google Nest and becoming the umbrella brand for all of Google smart home products. As part of that move and a new focus on privacy, the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program will be axed by the end of August, replaced by Google Assistant. And that leaves a big opening for Google's smart home competitors.Source: Google Here's why. &quot;Works With Nest&quot; Will No Longer Work With Nest One of the themes at Google I/O 2019 was a commitment to privacy. Owners of Nest smart home products -- now known as Google Nest smart home products -- soon discovered that means big changes for their devices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoogle announced that at the end of August, it is ending the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program. That means other smart home devices that integrated with Nest products will lose their access. The company is hoping product developers will release updates to make the devices compatible with its &quot;Works With Google Assistant&quot; program, but that requires investment on the part of the device makers. And it also means that most of these devices won't have access to anywhere near the same data they currently get from Nest. An Opening for CompetitorsThe smart home market is a big one, and it is seeing rapid growth. According to the latest numbers from IDC, shipment of smart home devices is expected to increase 26.9% year-over-year for 2019, hitting 832.7 million units. The market leaders are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung both beginning to make an impact. Growth has largely been driven by smart speakers to this point, but for 2019, that segment is projected to slow significantly. Instead, the big gains are expected to be in categories like smart lighting and home monitoring.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills According to IDC's analysts:&quot;2019 will be more about tying the various devices together to form a more cohesive experience and more importantly, layering in additional services.&quot;And that's where Google's move to axe the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program is going to hurt, at least in the short term. Third-party companies have already begun to notify customers that their smart home products will cease to integrate with Nest devices, &quot;breaking&quot; smart home systems that may have been working for years. The Verge notes that this extends to some pretty big partnerships. For example, Amazon's Alexa will no longer be able to adjust temperatures on a Nest thermostat and users will no longer be able to ask Alexa to display video feeds from a Nest Cam. In addition, the loss of IFTTT support cuts Nest devices out of many other smart home setups.Speaking from personal experience, I have a Nest thermostat that is integrated with both an air quality sensor (which kicks on the furnace fan to increase air circulation when elevated CO2 levels are detected), and my home security system (which uses the Nest to automatically adjust temperatures based on security status). Neither of these systems works with Google Assistant, so they are likely to cease functioning later this summer. Based on the data they require, neither is likely to work the same way, even if they are eventually transitioned to the Works With Google Assistant program.    * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade In other words, Google's move runs contrary to the driving trend IDC and others see in the smart home market. The timing opens the doors to competitors to move in and gain ground on Nest in the smart home. Amazon will undoubtedly be pushing hard, and smaller competitors see an opening they are preparing to capitalize on. Ecobee, for example, is rumored to not only have a new smart thermostat in the works, but also an expansion into smart home security with a camera and sensors.  Move Is Unlikely to Help GOOGL Stock … For NowWhen Google bought Nest Labs in 2014 for $3.2 billion, it acquired the leader in smart thermostats and smoke detectors, and one of the biggest names in smart home integration. With the growth of the smart home, this had significant upside for GOOGL stock. However, for the first few years, Nest floundered under Google ownership and at one point, it seemed on the verge of imploding. The brand has stabilized recently and expanded into video doorbells, outdoor cameras and other smart home security components.Long term, Google's newfound dedication to privacy is likely to pay off. But in the short term, at least, there is going to be some pain as Works with Nest is shut down and many smart home adopters see their integrated systems suddenly become a lot &quot;dumber as a result. That's going to make Nest products a tougher sell, cause resentment and open the doors for competitors to move in.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since a massive upward spike following the settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it continued a move upward before finding a new trading range. The recently released earnings report became a mild drag on Qualcomm stock. Now, with the battle with Apple over, another obstacle has arisen that could create another buying opportunity in QCOM stock.Source: Karlis Dambrans via FlickrBack in December, I predicted that 5G would end the winter of discontent for QCOM stock. The first sign of that came when Qualcomm settled with Apple and the shares spiked more than 37% higher in 24 hours as the companies announced the agreement. The iPhone maker likely concluded that QCOM could serve its needs better than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in this regard and cut a deal. QCOM Stock's Found a New Trading RangeSince that spike, QCOM stock has leveled off over the last couple of weeks. It also fell slightly after earnings and the company's guide lower. Admittedly, the present financials appear uninspiring. Analysts expect only 6.8% earnings growth this fiscal year. The current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stands at 44.6.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Nonetheless, investors should not assume that they have missed out on QCOM stock. Thanks to 5G, the picture improves dramatically in the next fiscal year. As recently as a month ago, analysts predicted $4.35 per share in earnings for fiscal 2020. Reaction to the Apple settlement added a buck to that and the projection now stands at $5.38 per share. China's the Next HeadwindThat settled, another political battle has now emerged. Unlike the dispute with Apple, this fight appears in the geopolitical realm, largely outside of the company's control.The majority of the company's revenue comes from China. This places possible near-term pressure on the QCOM as the trade dispute between the U.S. and the People's Republic continues to simmer and flare.On the flip side, China may find it needs to follow Apple's lead. The need for 5G may force them to come to an agreement similar to the one Apple made with Qualcomm. I would not expect another 37% one-day spike in such an instance. Still, such a settlement would easily break QCOM stock out of the range where it has traded in recent weeks. Low PE, High Payout Adds to QCOM Stock AppealTo be sure, even if such a deal takes some time, other factors make QCOM stock worth the wait. Despite the much-higher earnings projection for fiscal 2020, the forward PE comes in at just 15.7x. That multiple will bring an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.5% that year. Going further out, Wall Street projects average annual profit increases of 27.05% per year over the next five years.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes Furthermore, Qualcomm will make it worth it for investors to wait for the 5G revolution. Qualcomm's current dividend stands at $2.48 a share, which takes the yield to just over 2.9%. While that pales in comparison to the 4.3% yield before the price spike, it still comes in well above S&P 500 index averages. QCOM has also increased this payout every year for the last eight years. If these payout hikes remained safe during the recent years of struggle for QCOM stock, they should continue once consumers begin buying 5G-compatible devices. Final Thoughts on QCOM StockFollowing its settlement with Apple, QCOM stock again trades in a range as the company faces its next battle. The magnitude of QCOM's post-settlement move, coupled with a mixed earnings report, may weigh on the equity for now. Moreover, the company relies on China for the majority of its revenue. Such concerns could bring the same stagnation to Qualcomm stock that the shares faced during the Apple dispute.However, much like Apple, China may also have to agree to a trade settlement to move forward in 5G. Once the China situation becomes more settled and manufacturers begin to sell 5G-compatible phones in earnest, QCOM stock will have nowhere to go but up.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

4134,0.9925,"It's been a long while since General Electric (NYSE:GE) has created any real inspiration for investors. It's been so long, in fact, that the market may not recognize it when they see it, or perhaps not believe it even if they recognize it.Source: Shutterstock Consider this your official notice that GE stock is almost a buy again. It's a speculative, risky buy that's not for the faint of heart. But, it's almost a buy nonetheless.An impending technical event also marks the turning point of the rhetoric that's made General Electric stock such a headache to follow. Or maybe, it's the other way around.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Possible Daybreak for GE StockIt's not a story that needs much in the way of retelling. GE stock continued to climb through 2016, reflective of its pedigree. Beginning in 2017, though, years' worth of poor-decision making and obfuscation finally came home to roost. The company was (and still is) sitting on more debt than it can manage, and General Electric can't figure out its role in the current, digitally-driven marketplace. The fact that it has seen three different CEOs over the course of the past couple of years speaks volumes.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips There's a path out of its trouble, to be clear. Its Power unit desperately needs to figure out why its wares aren't marketable, and it needs to decide if it wants to be in the healthcare business or not. The once-vaunted organization also needs to get a grip on its debt. Here, shedding assets is logical but may not be the most optimal solution.There's no denying, however, that where GE is now is a much better place than where it was last year. The most recent quarter's cash burn was a relatively modest $1.2 billion, versus the $2.16 billion in negative cash flow analysts were modeling. Earnings topped expectations as well.It's difficult to call it conclusive evidence of a turnaround. Even CEO Larry Culp conceded during last quarter's conference call that &quot;One quarter is a data point, not a trend.&quot;All new trends start with a pivotal quarter though, yet most of those pivots are largely dismissed in their infancy. Turnarounds HappenCase in point? None other than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Think back to the mid-1990's, years after Steve Jobs stepped down as chief. Innovation and revenue had deteriorated, opening a huge window of opportunity for rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at a key time for the computer industry. Apple was almost bankrupt, but Steve Jobs took the helm again in 1997 and steered the company back to profitability.Few thought it could happen at the time, however.Lower profile but just-as-impressive turnarounds have also taken shape in the modern era.Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is one of them. After being nearly run out of the electronics business by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), turnaround expert Hubert Joly took over in 2012. By the end of 2017, it was clear his plan was working. More income growth in the meantime confirms the company is out of trouble.As it turns out, the suggestion made back in early 2012 that &quot;Electronics retailer Best Buy is headed for the exits&quot; wasn't quite on-target. It certainly seemed like the inevitable outcome at the time though.Point being, don't sweat the doubt: we've seen it before. Investors and analysts will change their tune when they must. And, they may have to sooner than later. Looking Ahead for General Electric StockTo that end, and not unlike the five psychological stages of dealing with grief, investors' perception of a turnaround generally follow a sequence. One of the earliest stages is, of course, denial. That's where most investors may be right now. It's holding General Electric stock back.  Click to EnlargeWe're awfully close to the bargaining and acceptance stages though. GE stock only needs to travel a tad higher to convince enough readied investors that the worst is in the past. Namely, shares only need to push above the resistance line that's touched all the key highs going back to last May before everything changes. It's only about 20 cents above the equity's current price.But rhetoric and headlines still aren't bullish enough to sustain a post-breakout rally? Don't give the media and the mob so much credit. The news and opinions in this particular case reflect the changing chart. They don't drive those changes. Look for a swath of &quot;I told ya so&quot; stories to take shape if GE stock can get to $11 per share, which will fan the bullish flames.At the very least it's a stock worth adding to your watch list.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

4153,0.9035,"Need a ride? These days you're very likely to call on Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) for that service. But if you're dealing with the stock market, the price chart is saying Lyft stock is a short position worth hailing. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Rideshare operator Lyft continued to disappoint investors on Wednesday. Just over five weeks into life as a publicly traded company, LYFT shares tumbled nearly 11% to fresh all-time-lows.Behind the session's hit and run, Lyft stock had a couple drivers to blame. A staged drivers' strike across rideshare platforms Lyft and Uber by its contract drivers demanding more pay certainly didn't help matters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors have also been coming to terms with the possibility that Lyft's IPO may have been aggressively priced. And with competitor Uber debuting on the NYSE Friday, those worries are now coming to a head.Lastly, a disastrous-looking and larger-than-expected loss of $9.02 per share in Lyft's inaugural earnings report as a publicly traded company likely forced some investors out.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips In all fairness, Lyft's quarterly confessional did offer investors reasons to be positive. For its part, Wall Street's analyst community applauded Lyft's better-than-forecast sales growth, solid ridership numbers and duopoly market positio, while the costly trend of subsidized rides to attract customers is mostly in the rear-view mirror. LYFT Stock Price Chart    As Lyft stock has been stressing in its short life as a vehicle for investment, buying an IPO out-the-gate or even enjoying a piece of the IPO itself, is no guarantee of having the next Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in your portfolio.Every single shareholder who has purchased shares in the open market is now underwater with Wednesday's humbling decline to all-time-lows. That pain has even been felt by investors who were allocated shares at the Lyft IPO price of $72. But the worst of it may not be over either.Technically, Wednesday's drop also marked a breakdown. Lyft stock had been trading laterally for just over three weeks. Coupled with stochastics rolling over from overbought territory and volume heavy, but not showing definitive signs of capitulation, LYFT is a short until proven differently. Lyft Stock Short PositionFor traders able and willing to short Lyft stock, there's no need to wait in line for a ride downtown. I'd recommend a blended exit above $58 to contain risk. This amounts to exposure of just under 10%.As a volatile stock, this stop-loss strategy allows for some necessary wiggle room back through lateral resistance, while still respecting the reversal as potentially an important turn-for-the-better for the bull case.Alternatively and for like-minded options traders, the June 17 $52.50/$45 put spread for $3 looks like a nice reduced-risk and ironclad way to position as a bear.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

It has since been updated and republished.]Now is a good time to be a financial advisor, and having the right technology at your disposal is one of the keys to success.Source: Salesforce InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe number of financial advisors in the U.S. has been falling yearly from its 2008 peak, as industry veterans retire. At the same time, wealth transfer has been creating an increasing number of millionaires in the Generation X and Generation Y populations. And they want your services.According to CNBC, 62% of those Gen X millionaires would like their financial advisor to provide more services, and they're willing to pay for it. In comparison only 25% of Baby Boomers are interested in additional services.The catch? 53% of the Gen X millionaires say they would ditch their financial advisor if they weren't using technology to enhance their services.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips To help you stay ahead of the curve and take advantage of the opportunities, here are five must-have tech tools for financial advisors. 5 Must-Have Tech Tools for Financial Advisors: Website Source: Weebly We're going to go out on a limb here and assume that you already have financial planning software. That's pretty much a given for a financial advisor. But do you have a website?And by a website, that doesn't mean a static page with your logo, office hours and contact info. Include aspects that will draw in visitors, with fresh and relevant content, like a blog. A professional, well-designed website helps to increase visibility 24/7, makes a great first impression and can help to position you as an expert. Hire a professional, or take a crack at it yourself with tools like Duda or Weebly.And while you're at it, make use of tools like Google Analytics to see how many visitors your website received, which pages they hit and where they came from. Doing so could help you to increase traffic, and more visitors means more potential clients. 5 Must-Have Tech Tools for Financial Advisors: CRMEvery professional who deals directly with customers on a regular basis needs good CRM (Client Relationship Management) software, and a financial advisor is no different.A good CRM does much more than store your client's contact info.You can begin to build a file on your client, filled with relevant dates. It can generate reminders that tell you when you should reach out to contact them. It can record the details of your last meeting or phone call with the client. It can also track performance. You want access from your smartphone, in case you need to contact a client when you're away from the office. In short, a CRM is far more than a computerized Rolodex, it's an invaluable high-tech tool.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips There are many CRMs to choose from, some that you buy outright, and some with a yearly licence. Popular options include Salesforce, ZOHO and Insightly. Most offer a free trial, or at least a web-based tutorial so you can check out the interface and capabilities to make sure it suits your needs. 5 Must-Have Tech Tools for Financial Advisors: Virtual Meeting SupportSource: Microsoft One of the most important tech tools for a financial advisor -- especially one with clients in a younger demographic -- is the ability to accommodate virtual meetings.Baby Boomers are accustomed to coming into your office for a meeting. But with younger generations, taking time out to drive across town and sit down in an office is less popular. Many companies have been using video conferencing tools for virtual meetings between offices for decades now. The technology is pretty much taken for granted at this point and has trickled down to the personal level. So make sure that you have a computer or mobile device equipped with a good camera, a place to hold virtual meeting (you don't want a table littered with dirty coffee cups in the background) and accounts with popular video conferencing software.Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype is the big name in video conferencing. Webex is a popular choice if you want to be able to share your screen with a remote client, so they can follow along with information displayed on your computer. 5 Must-Have Tech Tools for Financial Advisors: Social Media Management ToolsSource: Hootsuite Whatever you might think of social media, the reality is it's not going anywhere. And it's become a valuable marketing tool, as well as a way to interact with clients and potential clients.As a financial advisor, you'll want to have a social media presence. But to prevent social media from becoming a time drain and to get the most out of your accounts, you should also consider social media management tools. Popular options like Buffer and Hootsuite let you manage all your social media accounts from one interface. You can use these tools to schedule posts (so you remain active with fresh content even when you're busy).   * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips You can also analyze the performance of your posts so you can see what topics and channels have the greatest payoff. 5 Must-Have Tech Tools for Financial Advisors: Professional TabletSource: Apple With the emphasis on financial advisors being plugged-in and tech-savvy, the last thing you want a client to see is an aging beige PC sitting in your office. The latest generation of professional tablets is ideal for professionals like financial advisors.A powerful tablet like Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad Pro or Microsoft's Surface Pro are high performance computers in their own right. Add a keyboard case and they can replace a laptop. They're equipped with cameras for those virtual meetings and capable of running pretty much any software you might need -- especially the Surface Pro, that comes with Windows 10 Pro. They are even offered with optional LTE connectivity. Using a tablet shows clients that you are on top of current tech trends. The big display that can be handed over to someone sitting across from you makes an ideal presentation tool. It's also far lighter than a laptop if you visit a client at their home and with LTE, you have full online connectivity without having to ask for their Wi-Fi password…There's a lot of technology out there and this isn't a comprehensive list of everything a financial planner needs. But these five must-haves are a great starting point for taking full advantage of current industry trends.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

4213,0.993,"Yesterday, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division held the keynote to its annual developer conference, Google I/O 2019. While there was plenty to talk about, including a newfound dedication to privacy, Android Q, a &quot;next generation&quot; Android Assistant and big moves on the Google Nest front, what's making headlines this morning is the new Google Pixel 3a smartphone. If you're a consumer, there's a lot to like about Google's affordable new phone.Source: Google But is the Pixel 3a the right move for Google and GOOGL stock? Will it do what three generations of flagship Pixel phones have failed to do and jumpstart sales? Google Announces the Affordable Pixel 3aAt its Google I/O 2019 keynote event, Google announced a new, affordable smartphone: the Pixel 3a (and Pixel 3a XL).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhere the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL start at $799 and $899, respectively, the Pixel 3a is $399, while the 3a XL starts at $479.The big news is that the new affordable Pixel smartphones include the same camera that Google has been winning accolades for. The processor may be a bit slower (a Snapdragon 670 instead of a Snapdragon 845), but it's still a solid performer, and the display is an OLED panel. Other then the CPU, the primary cost-cutting measures on Google's part have been to use polycarbonate instead of glass for the back panel and to leave out water resistance and wireless charging. There's also no second front camera for wide angle selfies.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Those who aren't big on current design trends may even prefer the Pixel 3a, which lacks a screen notch and brings back the headphone jack.Why go affordable? Despite having what has been arguably the best camera in the business (Huawei's latest can top it but it is not available in the U.S.), after three generations, the Google Pixel smartphone has failed to win a meaningful marketshare. In 2017, the company reportedly sold 3.9 million units -- less than the number of iPhones rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was moving in a single week. And while Pixel sales had been showing signs of improvement -- at least in the U.S. market -- that has not been the case in 2019. During Alphabet's earnings call, declining Pixel sales were addressed directly by the company's CFO:&quot;Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industrywide, given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market.&quot;Going lower priced has worked for Apple. Its iPhone XR has reportedly been outselling both the iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max combined. Even More Affordable (For a Limited Time)At $399, the Pixel 3a is a deal, but Google is sweetening the pot even further for a limited time. The company is offering 24 months of zero interest financing, that means consumers can pick up the new smartphone for under $17 monthly. It's also throwing in three free months of YouTube Music Premium. Trade in an old iPhone and Google knocks the price down to as low as $149.And until May 18, the company is offering a $100 credit with purchase to spend at the Google Store. The Risk(s) of CannibalizationSmartphone makers have always worried about cannibalizing their own sales if they release cheaper alternatives to their flagships. Google is unique in that the Pixel 3a could actually do this in several ways.First, the obvious. By equipping the Pixel 3a with the stellar camera of the Pixel 3, then charging half the price, Google is risking cutting into sales of its flagship smartphones. Many consumers buy a smartphone for its camera, and now those who were circling a Pixel 3 have the option of saving themselves $400. But the Pixel phones, in general, were also meant to be Android showcases, smartphones that would tempt users away from Apple's iPhone. However, in reality, research has shown that most Pixel buyers who are converting from another brand are former Samsung owners. There's a risk the $399 Pixel 3a may only accelerate that trend of winning sales form existing Android manufacturers.  * 7 Tips for Financial Planners to Gain a Competitive Edge The upside for GOOGL stock is the likelihood for increased hardware unit sales. The potential downsides are a lower ASP and the possibility of less revenue even if overall smartphone unit sales are up -- plus the risk of little net change in Android adoption marketshare. Throwing Down the Gauntlet to AppleWith its latest smartphone, Google has signaled that it is serious about winning market share. The Pixel 3 hasn't been able to do that, despite an award-winning camera. But the Pixel 3a's affordable starting price sends a clear message, especially to Apple, whose &quot;affordable&quot; model iPhone XR is priced $350 higher. Google is ready to play hardball.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

4215,0.996,"Yesterday was one of the biggest in the calendar of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division. Google I/O 2019 -- the company's annual developer conference -- kicked off with today's keynote.It's a big deal for consumers, industry watchers and investors. Some 85% of the company's revenue comes through advertising, so all the latest software developments designed to keep consumers hooked on Android are important. And the company also announced new hardware, as it continues to work toward diversifying revenue and reducing the dependence of GOOGL stock on advertising.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips There was a lot on tap during the duration of the event, but here are five of the big announcements from today's Google I/O 2019 keynote.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips &quot;Next Generation&quot; Google AssistantSource: Google Thanks to machine learning, Google Assistant is now up to 10 times faster. Google is referring to the technology as &quot;next generation&quot; and in addition to being faster, it's getting much better at context and gains a driving mode (coming as a free update this summer).Also seeing big leaps in capability are other AI-powered Google services including Google Lens, Duplex and Live Transcribe. Pixel 3a SmartphonesSource: Google Google's Pixel smartphones have impressed, especially with their camera capabilities. But they've failed to build a significant market share.To help boost sales, Google is introducing a new pair of mid-range smartphones called the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. Starting at $399 ($479 for the 3a XL), these new smartphones are half the price of most flagship devices. They offer a camera experience on par with the Pixel 3, including Night Sight, Portrait Mode and Super Res Zoom and feature OLED displays (and a headphone jack). Google cut costs by using a Snapdragon 670 processor instead of the more expensive Snapdragon 845 in the Pixel 3, using cheaper plastic instead of a glass for the back panel, forgoing wireless charging and skipping water resistance.  * 6 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The Pixel3a and 3a XL are available starting today. NestSource: Google Google accidentally leaked the Nest Hub Max prior to today's event, so it seemed likely that new Nest gear was on tap. And yes, the company did announce the Nest Hub Max, a smart speaker with a camera and big 10-inch display.But the company had a surprise up its sleeve: all Google Home products will be coming under the Nest brand umbrella. Coming late this summer, the Nest Hub Max will be priced at $229, while the original Google Hub (now the Nest Hub) gets a price cut to $129. Android QSource: Google Android is the operating system that powers the vast majority of smartphones, and keeping that dominance -- which helps to keep that ad revenue flowing through native Google services -- is critical to the bottom line, and to the continued growth of Google stock. Today the company showed off features of Android Q (alternately known as Android 10), including support for folding smartphones (like Samsung's Galaxy Fold), a new dark mode and new navigation gestures.  * 3 Oil Stocks to Buy in a Recovering Refining Market Also coming to Google users both mobile and PC-based, is a new emphasis on privacy and security, with the option to automatically delete your history in services including Search, Maps and Google Assistant. In addition, Search and Maps will get an incognito mode for private use. Google I/O 2019: Android AutoSource: Google While it was announced shortly before the keynote itself, the update to Android Auto is an important one.Google has revamped the user interface, with the new version of the software coming this summer. Android Auto's UI is now adaptable to different screen sizes, which is needed with more auto makers now offering the system in their vehicles. Navigation between apps is improved and Google says more info is now available to drivers at a glance.That's it for big news out of Google I/O 2019 today. But there's another huge tech developer conference less than a month away. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) WWDC 2019 is coming up in less than a month.

But Nike stock is pulling back in early May, amid a stock-market selloff sparked by renewed trade war threats.Source: Shutterstock As of this writing, Nike stock is 7% off its recent highs, marking the biggest drop in NKE stock in 2019.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Investors should perceive the recent weakness of Nike stock as a buying opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn general, Nike is firing on all cylinders and extending its leadership position in an athletic-apparel market that has been, still is, and will remain on fire. This favorable positioning sets NKE up to report healthy, robust revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future. As a result,  Nike stock will stay on a healthy medium to long-term uptrend.Further, with respect to the near-term, NKE has a few major fundamental catalysts on the horizon which should get many investors to buy Nike stock soon.All in all, it won't be long before Nike stock is making new all time highs. Consequently, NKE stock should be bought on its recent weakness. The Athletic Apparel Space Remains Red HotThere are five reasons to buy the dip of Nike stock in May. The first of those five reasons is that athletic apparel remains as hot and in-demand as ever.Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) just reported another stellar quarter which dazzled investors and sent that stock up to all-time highs.  Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) has been on fire for a long time and has only improved in recent quarters. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) just reported its best numbers in recent memory, including a 25% sales jump in the Asia-Pacific region.Everywhere you look, athletic apparel is still on fire. Nike is the unchallenged king of this space. As a result, as long as the athletic-apparel industry remains red hot, so will Nike. NKE Hasn't Experienced Any Trouble in ChinaThe second big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that the company has proven largely resilient to trade-war noise.Specifically, in late 2018, many U.S. companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), reported that their China businesses had weakened thanks to slowing economic conditions  sparked by the trade conflict. Nike was not one of those companies. Instead, Nike's China business remained healthy and vigorous. Throughout all of fiscal 2018, NKE's China sales rose 18%. Its China sales rose 20% in the first quarter of 2019, 31% in Q2, and 24% in Q3.In other words, Nike's China business has yet to be negatively impacted by trade-war issues or the slowing Chinese economy. Consequently, the current  weakness of Nike stock seems overstated. Tiger Woods Is BackThe third big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that the company's golf business will get a nice bump this quarter and perhaps for the foreseeable future.That's because Nike golf star Tiger Woods is back. In mid-April, Tiger Woods won the 2019 Masters golf tournament for the first time in 14 years, completing what many are calling one of the greatest comeback stories in sports history. That comeback story caused certain Nike golf apparel to sell  out on Nike's website in the 24 hours after Woods' victory.Nike's quarterly results should reflect the rebound of its golf business sparked by Woods' victory. As long as Woods remains relevant, this lift should persist. The Freak Shoe Launches SoonThe fourth (and arguably the biggest) reason to buy Nike stock in May is that this company is heading into what looks  to be a massive signature basketball shoe launch, and prior successful signature basketball shoe launches have sparked huge rallies by NKE stock.Specifically, Nike is set to release a signature basketball shoe for NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo within the next few weeks. The shoe, dubbed The Freak 1, will likely debut to enormous demand, considering Giannis is widely loved by fans, is one of the best players in the NBA, and has a unique underdog story which consumers will strongly relate to. Furthermore, prior signature basketball shoe launches by NBA stars Kyrie Irving and Paul George sparked big multi-quarter rallies of Nike stock.The same thing should happen this time around. The Freak 1 will launch in May. Demand will be robust. NKE will sell a ton of basketball shoes. The numbers will improve, causing NKE stock to head higher. Women's Pivot Unlocks Enormous Long-Term PotentialThe last big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that this company is only scratching the surface of its long-term potential in the women's athletic-apparel business.At the current moment, Nike's revenues are dominated by the men's segment. The women's business accounts for less than a quarter of its total revenues. But the global women's athletic apparel and footwear market is 50% larger than the men's athletic apparel and footwear market. Nike knows that, understands the huge potential  of its women's business, and is doing everything possible to grow its women's business, with management calling it a &quot;huge priority&quot; on the company's last earnings call.I think the revenue of Nike's women's business can reach $20 billion-plus over the next several years, and that's enough to enable Nike stock to march towards $100 this year. The Bottom Line on NKE StockNike stock is tumbling against the backdrop of the stock market selloff. But the recent weakness of Nike stock is nothing more than a buying opportunity. Over the long-term, NKE has all the pieces it needs to generate healthy revenue and profit growth. In the near-term, NKE has some major catalysts on the horizon which could turn this selloff into a rally rather quickly.It won't be long before Nike stock is printing fresh, all-time highs again.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NKE, LULU, and AAPL.

4233,0.9863,"With stock markets close to their  all-time highs, the recovery of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock seems to have been almost overlooked.Source: Shutterstock Trading close to $190, and just off recent highs. FB stock now has risen over 50% from its December lows, increasing its market capitalization by about $200 billion in the process.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips In fact, FB is only about 15% away from retaking its all-time highs. Those were reached last August, just before the market value of Facebook stock plunged by the largest amount in history. In the context of that plunge - and the selling pressure that continued into December - the rebound of FB stock seems nothing short of miraculous.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe question now is whether the rally can keep going. That ,in turn, seems to require understanding why FB stock has soared 50%. At the moment, it looks like investors are betting on Facebook stock for reasons that go beyond the Facebook platform. As a result,  the big gains of FB stock might not end anytime soon. Why Has FB Stock Soared?The bear case on FB stock seems easy, almost too easy. The endlessly negative noise plaguing the Facebook platform, starting with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and on through seemingly recurring privacy concerns, at some point will lead some users to abandon the website, the bears say.That would be a real problem for Facebook, since the departure of some users, in theory, should lead other users to follow suit. For a social network like Facebook, more users lead to more users. Fewer users, then, should produce a snowball effect. That's what happened to MySpace, which was displaced by Facebook. Any cracks in FB's user base could allow a new competitor to do the same thing to Facebook.There have been two real problems with that bear case in practice, however. The first, as I wrote back in late March, is that users don't particularly seem to care about the company's scandals.The company's daily active user base continues to rise, growing 8% year-over-year in the first quarter. And the second problem with the bears' outlook is that Facebook stock no longer is based solely on the Facebook website. The company owns Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which have yet to be efficiently monetized.And so the worst-case scenario for FB stock simply hasn't played out. In fact, looking just at Facebook's numbers in general and its revenue in particular, an investor might not even know there was anything to worry about. Its user base is still growing off a staggeringly large base; Facebook ended Q1 with 1.56 billion daily active users. Moreover, WhatsApp and Instagram are showing signs of progress  and growth.For all the noise, what should really matter to the owners of Facebook stock - the size of the Facebook platform's user base and the opportunities of the company's ancillary businesses - hasn't really changed. It doesn't mean that those who believed otherwise were silly. Rather, FB has proven to be much more resilient than its critics believed. The Impact of &quot;Less Facebook&quot; on  Facebook StockThe bull case for Facebook stock, then, relies on the core platform staying resilient  and the rest of its business growing.CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly has said he is focusing on protecting users' privacy. If users have concerns - and many no doubt do - Zuckerberg is trying to assuage those concerns. At this point, Facebook doesn't need to be revolutionary or miraculous; it simply needs to be safe and good. It certainly seems like the company is moving in that direction.But it's the moves outside the company's main platform that are perhaps more interesting. Just this week, Facebook announced a redesigned app for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS operating system. But it's also adding a native Messenger clients for PC and Mac desktops. That's part of the company's effort to separate Messenger from Facebook , cementing the company's positioning in messaging, not just social media.That strategy has been going on for quite awhile now. Instagram clearly is copying features from Snap Inc's (NYSE:SNAP) website,  Snapchat. FB has also made a modest effort to challenge Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) in dating. Meanwhile, FB is using both Messenger and WhatsApp to gain exposure to the lucrative communications industry as well. And it certainly seems like that strategy - along with a stickier user base than the bears imagined - has boosted FB stock so far in 2019. Can Facebook Stock Keep Rising?The question at this point is whether FB's strategy can get Facebook stock to $200 and beyond. Certainly, the idea that Facebook could offset some modest pressure on the namesake platform with efforts elsewhere has helped FB stock in recent months. But the problem at the moment is that FB stock is no longer cheap.Even after backing out the company's cash hoard, FB trades at about 25 times analysts' consensus 2019 earnings per share estimates. FB's earnings growth is likely to resume in 2020,  as Facebook expects its 2019 spending spike - the same spike that tanked FB stock back in August - to moderate next year. So there's room for Facebook stock to rise, but perhaps there's not as much as room for FB to climb as when the stock was trading for under 20 times earnings not all that long ago.That said, there's a path for FB to rise. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the company's EPS to soar  next year thanks to its lower spending.  The consensus 2019 EPS estimate is just above $7; in 2020, the average EPS estimate is $9.32, representing 30%+ growth. FB stock - again backing out its cash - does trade at less than 20 times next year's consensus outlook. Bump its EPS closer to $10, slap on a 20+ multiple, and Facebook stock gets to $240. That would be an all-time high for FB.That kind of rally isn't guaranteed. FB is facing external risks, notably the aggressive entrance of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) into the advertising space.But what we've seen in 2019 is a clear change in  sentiment towards Facebook stock. Users aren't leaving, which has allowed investors and management to focus on the company's opportunities beyond the core platform. As long as both those trends continue, FB stock should continue to rise.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

On April 1, SNE stock was staring at near-double digit losses. But since that day, shares have absolutely soared, gaining almost 22%. Even after the overall market's stumble this week, SNE stock is still in the black for the year to the tune of about 2%.Of course, this is nothing compared to its top-dog rivals. Apple has gained 30% year-to-date. Microsoft is no slouch either, up 25%. But Sony stock levers something these other two companies don't: the almighty PlayStation video-game console.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate last week, the on-again, off-again tech firm released the first details about its next-generation console. If management keeps to its naming convention, it will be called the PlayStation 5, or PS5. However, SNE has done some strange things in the past, so the name is no guarantee.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May But what is almost guaranteed is that the PS5 will be a game-changer for Sony stock. Over the years, management has made significant investments into their entertainment umbrella. The PS5 represents the culmination of these (expensive) efforts.Specifically, here are three reasons why you can bank on SNE stock and the upcoming PS5, or whatever it will be called: Sony's New Gaming System Is Loaded with TechEvery PlayStation console represented a leap forward in gaming visuals. Back when the PS3 came out, people marveled at the life-like graphics. When Sony launched the successor PS4, the line between virtual reality and actual reality became all the more blurred.Sometimes, when I quickly glance at a PS4 screenshot, I can't tell whether I'm looking at a video game or a real-life broadcast. The PS5 promises to push the bar even higher. SNE confirmed that this latest gaming hardware will utilize chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Specifically, we're talking about a CPU based on third-gen Ryzen, and eight cores of the Zen 2 seven-nanometer microchip.Given the massive sales success of the PS4, I think we'll see dramatic metrics for the successor. Therefore, don't be surprised to see Sony stock jump around the release date.Furthermore, one of the biggest differences for the next-gen PlayStation is that it will incorporate a solid-state drive. Currently, Sony's consoles integrate traditional hard drives, which have improved dramatically over the years. However, they're incredibly slow in this age of ultra-fast response rates.Although I love my PS4, I don't care for the several seconds I must wait for my game to transition from one major section to another. A solid-state drive, which features no moving parts, gets to the data much quicker than a regular hard drive.Of course, a solid-state drive costs significantly more than its counterpart. Management wants to keep the PS5 reasonably priced, so we'll see how that goes. However, I don't think consumers will mind paying more for a quicker platform. Content Umbrella Favors Sony StockYou don't have to be an entertainment-media expert to recognize the growing trend in consolidation. Earlier, market pundits debated the wisdom of AT&T (NYSE:T) expensively acquiring Time Warner. Next, analysts shined the spotlight on Disney (NYSE:DIS) and its bid for Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) entertainment assets.Conservative investors didn't like that these big but vulnerable corporations were buying out others like them. Instead, they should have focused on shoring up their financials and building steady value for their shareholders.I appreciate this perspective. That said, I also appreciate that the nature of entertainment has changed, particularly with streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Today, it's more important than ever to deliver content that attracts both eyeballs and revenue-conversion opportunities. If you have good content, you can win despite the platform.Sony understands this entertainment trend better than most, which is why I trust SNE stock. They invested heavily into their own exclusive content umbrella. Observing these expenditures from the outside may lead you to believe that SNE is wasting money. Instead, what they're really doing is securing viable, lucrative synergies.One of the best ways they can leverage their entertainment portfolio is through PlayStation-exclusive titles. Here's the thing: other rivals also have exclusives. What makes Sony, and by logical deduction SNE stock distinct, though, is demand: people actually want to play Sony-only games. They're more than willing to fork over money for a new console to do so.Just look at the roaring success for Marvel's Spider-Man. Such massive inflows are only possible through leveraging popular branded content. While the initial investments were expensive, the potential for the PS5 to bring it all together is truly colossal.In other words, keep a very close eye on Sony stock. No Comparable Competition for SNE StockI'm a PlayStation guy for life. I don't think I can ever get used to the Xbox's strangely-shaped controls. They look like PS controls that were left in the microwave for some unknown reason.Of course, I'm incredibly biased as well. InvestorPlace readers may know me as that guy who worked for Sony. Naturally, I own Sony stock, so I have a vested interest in their continued upward trajectory.But even acknowledging that I'm not 100% objective, I don't think the company has comparable rivals in the gaming sector. I may tick off the Xbox folks, but the data confirms it. The PS4 is approaching the 100 million units sold mark. Although Microsoft doesn't break down Xbox figures, they're more or less approaching the 50 million threshold.But what about video-game streaming? Although streaming certainly has an impact on the broader gaming industry, I think this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. At least, that's the view when discussing SNE stock and the next-gen PlayStation.Streaming is designed to capture the very casual gamer. But for those that want the absolute best in visuals and experience, no substitute for a dedicated console exists. Briefly, we went over the tech that SNE will integrate into the PS5. To stream all that data would be a gargantuan undertaking.Plus, game-streaming competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) don't have content credibility. They're new to the game, and they can't whip out highly-desirable exclusives. Until they can climb these sharply vertical obstacles, your best bet in gaming is Sony stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE stock and T stock.

4241,0.9767,"Popular audio-streaming platform Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) didn't have a great 2018. Although Spotify stock soared soon after its initial public offering, shares suffered from both fundamental questions and bad timing. In the aftermath of last October's broader market correction, SPOT eventually closed out 2018 down 14%.Source: Spotify This year, SPOT stock is enjoying much better fortune. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up around 21%. But on the fundamental end, questions are piling up. Spotify didn't endear themselves to Wall Street, badly missing its earnings target for the first quarter of 2019. Adding to the uncertainty, management recently announced they're bringing voice-controlled advertisements to the streaming platform for a limited user base.Although increased interaction with smart devices represent the future, the concept of voice-controlled ads bring up dystopian imagery for me. Apparently, I'm not the only one. Gizmodo contributor Catie Keck blasted the move as an &quot;engagement hellscape.&quot; That's hardly a ringing endorsement for the new marketing direction or indirectly for Spotify stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May But I certainly understand Keck's reservations. Here's how this next-generation ad works: Spotify will initially target some users who have their microphone enabled. The streaming app will then feature an ad that requests the listener to speak a keyword. If the listener utters the magic phrase, the ad will presumably provide a detailed sales pitch. If not, the ad just plays out, and the music returns.Now, that doesn't sound too terrible. Some folks might say that this is a convenience, and therefore, a net benefit to SPOT stock. However, Keck looks out to future: what if advertisers inundate streaming channels with annoying phrase-requested ads, pestering you until you give in?Ticking off the user base is a no-no for Spotify stock. Why Voice-Controlled Ads Could Lift Spotify StockI share Keck's reservations. At the same time, every story has two sides. Keck speaks from the (free) end-user's perspective, who come to the table with many demands. On the other end sits the business angle. Here, the line is, beggars can't be choosers.Let's get down to the numbers. Recently, SPOT hit a major milestone, garnering more than 100 million paid users. Most notably, the music-streaming firm beat out rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which only has 50 million paid users. This fact alone makes Spotify stock a compelling look.However, the flipside is that the company projects 107 million to 110 million paid users against a total listening base between 222 million to 228 million users. Thus, a little over half are using Spotify's free service, which isn't a bad conversion rate. Unfortunately, the company still sheds money.In order to convince prospective buyers to remain interested in SPOT stock, management must try new conversion tactics. If that involves annoying listeners until they open their wallet, so be it. When you look at the rising number of paying subs, it's obvious that the music-listening audience have few viable alternatives.Sure, the growth rate in paid users has consecutively declined since Q1 2017. Bulls will counter, though, that this is merely the law of large numbers shifting its weight. And when you look at the metric objectively, the growth rate is still robust. Since Q1 2018, paid-user growth on a year-over-year basis averages just under 39%. From Q1 2016, the rate is 54%.In other words, Spotify is expanding one of its most critical components even after the &quot;newness&quot; factor has faded. But since the company is still not generating a profit, it must take its ventures to the next level. Voice-controlled ads could do the trick for Spotify stock. SPOT Stock Is Merely Adapting to Tech TrendsNo one likes commercials, even if they fund our &quot;free&quot; entertainment. Logically, then, no one wants these necessary evils to become more intrusive.Keck is right in that advertisers will game the system to somehow force watchers and listeners to pay attention, and later, to pay up. However, complaining about the ad industry's brave new world is ultimately a waste of time.Everywhere you turn, the digitalization sector is telegraphing voice-controlled ads. We live in a world where devices from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) act as our personal assistants. We speak to them, giving them orders and asking for information. Although the tech is not yet perfect, it's getting there.Therefore, it's inevitable that content marketed to us will come in the form of requested vocal engagement. Many folks may find this development disturbing. But don't blame Spotify stock: the underlying company is merely a product of its time.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

4242,0.9983,"Sometimes, the best investment is the one that just goes with the trend. For all that contrarian investors have tried to explain that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) valuation is stretched, that it's time is up, Netflix stock has continued higher.Source: Via NetflixAt the time of writing, valuations do look extreme at 135x earnings, but Netflix stock has run over those who have been caught short. Short-sellers may have very cogent theses and numerous reasons why Netflix stock is overvalued, but the price action over the past couple of years has put them in their place.The reality is that fighting the trend has been a losing proposition. YTD, Netflix stock performance has been stellar: up 42 percent, compared to the NASDAQ Composite's 26 percent.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes The FAANGs have stymied many value-oriented investors, and Netflix is no exception. Even now, its ascent skyward seems to show few signs of slowing. Netflix's Solid First QuarterSubscribers is the metric the market seems to care most about. Free cash flow, content spend, and even margins have taken a backseat to subscriber growth. On this front, Netflix is delivering. In the first quarter, average streaming paid memberships increased 26% year over year.  Excluding F/X, global streaming ARPU improved 3% year over year. This ultimately drove revenue growth of 22 percent.Paid net adds clocked in at 9.6 million. The US and international breakout is 1.74m and 7.86m, respectively. In aggregate, this 16 percent year-over-year increase set a quarterly record. For the first half of 2019, that gets Netflix to 14.6m paid net adds, up 7% year over year.The subscriber growth and price increase have been major factors in supporting the movement in Netflix stock and could continue in the second half of the year with new content being released. Netflix Takes on the WorldThe international business growth is worth paying close attention to. It's been the crux of many bear arguments. The idea is that the international market is fragmented due to different cultures with different tastes making it hard to compete with a small content library. There is a belief that regional competition will eat Netflix for lunch but that just hasn't happened.Netflix has gotten in early and continuously iterated their platform. They've learned about content that plays well and content that doesn't in local markets. The result is that, from a long-term standpoint, it's very likely that international business eclipses the U.S. business.With such a strong platform and compelling content, Netflix has been able to roll out price increases across the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and parts of Europe. It doesn't take a business school degree to know that pricing power is important and indicative of the durability of a brand.Demand for Netflix's high quality English-language content remains strong. The international business doesn't require much capital investment to scale across new markets, reducing that expansion risk significantly. Simply put, the risk/reward is very much in NFLX's favor. Given the size and growth profile of the international markets, there is huge value for NFLX to continue investing in them.With a &quot;strong slate of global content in the second half of the year,&quot; it's reasonable to expect a year of record annual paid net adds. Netflix Stock and the Virtuous CycleAs Netflix increases its content budget and their marketing strategies become more efficient, they can get more subscribers to the service. More global subscribers who are more engaged means richer valuation for Netflix stock.As of the most recent quarter, Netflix has hit nearly 150m paid members. With continued success in programming and a large global addressable market that can absorb new competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's a risky proposition to bet against the primary disruptor of linear television.

4243,0.9996,"Fitbit (NASDAQ: FIT) reported stronger than expected first quarter results on May 1. In addition to meaningfully beating top line and bottom line expectations, the results included multiple, other items that are tremendously positive for Fitbit stock.Source: Fitbit The company's revenue rose 10% year-over-year, its tracker revenue rose YoY for the first time in three years, its smartwatch revenue soared 117% YoY, and the revenue it obtains from companies and insurers jumped 70% YoY.Furthermore, FIT did not raise its 2019 guidance, but said it was not doing so only because it chose to be &quot;prudent,&quot; a code word for conservative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes  A Closer Look at FITStill, Fitbit stock fell meaningfully, as investors chose to focus on the few negative aspects of the company's results, including lower average selling prices and conservative Q2 guidance.I believe that these investors are making the classic mistake of focusing on the trees instead of the forest. That's because I think that FIT has a tremendous monetization opportunity that will enable Fitbit stock to at least double over the next year or two. Fitbit's strategy for monetizing its users on a massive level is becoming clear.FIT CEO James Park reported that a large study of diabetes prevention methods found that people who used Fitbit devices, &quot;were more active and lost more weight during the program than those who did not and were more likely to be engaged in the platform a year later.&quot;Additionally, subjects who used Fitbit devices averaged an hour more activity per week for much of the program than those who did not, he stated.Clearly, people who use step-tracking devices are more active and, consequently, less like to have diabetes, heart disease and some forms of cancer than those who do not use such devices.As I've written previously, insurers and employers have tremendous incentive to keep their employees and clients healthier.As a result, they will likely be willing to pay meaningful amounts of money to do so. Opportunities Abound for FitbitFitbit is already taking advantage of this opportunity on multiple fronts. Many Medicare Advantage programs, spread around 27 states, are covering Fitbit devices, Park reported. Furthermore, three national health plans are currently using Fitbit Care as their means for diabetes management. &quot;There's a lot of interest (among insurers) in our Fitbit Care product,&quot; Park said. With Fitbit Care, the company analyzes patients' data it obtains from its own devices as well as other devices. and uses that data to offer patients ways of improving their health. In the second half of this year, FIT plans to launch a premium offering for individuals based on Fitbit Care. I believe that, over time, Fitbit Care will be adopted by many employers, health insurers, and individuals. As everyone knows, obesity is a major problem in the U.S. and leads to tremendous health problems. Under the principle that &quot;what gets measured gets managed,&quot; step-tracking devices definitely help people become more active.  Employers and  health insurers have a financial interest in keeping their employees and clients healthy. And individuals, of course,  have many reasons to want to be healthier and avoid obesity, and Americans already spend a great deal of time  and money seeking to accomplish those goals. Therefore, I believe that there's a tremendous addressable market for Fitbit's devices, encompassing both enterprises and individuals. If FIT can obtain a sizable piece of that  market, FIT's results and FIT stock will definitely rise tremendously over the long-term.  Fitbit Stock and the Monetization WarFitbit is in a &quot;sweet spot&quot; that will allow it to become the leader of this huge addressable market. The smartwatches sold by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) are too expensive for most enterprises and many people who want to use step trackers to improve their health. At the same time, many enterprises and people will not be ready to trust Chinese companies who sell cheaper step trackers, but don't have well-respected brand names,  with the important task of helping themselves or their clients/employees improve their health. That leaves Fitbit and Samsung as the remaining options, and FIT's devices already meaningfully outsell those of Samsung, giving FIT an important advantage over its Korean competitor. I was disappointed that FIT did not make any new announcements regarding its devices' ability to diagnose diseases or take measurements that are crucial for individuals' health, such as blood oxygen levels or sleep apnea. In the past, I have said that Fitbit must make positive strides in those areas for FIT stock to rally. Still, the company noted that it was continuing to work with the FDA to &quot;test and develop&quot; those types of solutions, and I recognize that it takes a long time to get the agency to approve devices. More importantly, I'm now convinced that, over the next year or two, monetizing Fitbit Care will prove to be a tremendous, positive catalyst for FIT's results and FIT stock., enabling Fitbit stock to at least double during that time As of this writing, the author owned shares of FIT stock.

Still, when early investor demand is present, innovation is rampant and shares are part of a secular trend, IPOs can be solid stocks to buy.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio And in today's market PINS stock, ZM and BYND are three companies that fit the bill and are well positioned for much larger future success.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pinterest (PINS)  Click to EnlargePinterest is the first of our three IPO stocks to buy. PINS stock is a hugely popular web-based visual discovery platform that collects and shares ideas and activities. In turn, this enables and empowers users to build upon their own experiences.This innovative platform is poised for long-term growth despite being in a crowded consumer-facing digital economy. Pinterest already has more monthly active users than Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The company is also growing its digital ad revenues by nearly 60% and roughly twice the pace of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).And as InvestorPlace's Luke Lango notes, Pinterest solves the search shortcomings of a platform such as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google through its visual-first Pins which allow for personalization and contextualization even in the absence of a specific search.But that's not all that makes this the first of our three stocks to buy. As the price chart shows, PINS is in demand by investors.In its short time as publicly traded stock, shares are up nearly 25% from its opening price. Following a simple multi-day pullback pattern that found support off the 62% retracement level, Pinterest shares are in position to be purchased.My recommendation is to buy PINS stock on confirmation of Monday's pivot low as shares trade through $30, set your sights for profit-taking at $36 and use a drop below $28 as a blended approach to manage risk. Zoom Video (ZM)  Click to EnlargeThe second of our stocks to buy is ZM stock. Zoom Video is a comprehensive platform for video, voice, chat and content sharing. If you're thinking that's not exactly new technology, you'd be correct. But Zoom is breaking the mold in a business trend that's only going to continue growing.Zoom's mission of making its meetings better than in-person sit-downs is a new wrinkle in the space and it's proving wildly popular. Revenues are up more than five-fold over the past couple years to more than $330 million and cash flow from operations last year tallied in at $51.3 million.The big knock against buying ZM stock right now could be investor demand is too anxious. In its first couple weeks of trading, shares have continued to set new highs. And a price-to-sales multiple of around 47X, which InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli recently cautioned against, has ballooned to nearly 61X.The daily chart shows ZM stock's ever-expanding price-to-sales figure has occurred within a very constructive-looking uptrend. But given Zoom's stretched multiples, daily price volatility that's not for the squeamish and trend persistence fully capable of turning into its own worst enemy, today's buyers need to be careful.Currently, Zoom is a stock to buy in more aggressive trading accounts if new highs are made. This type of entry is based on price momentum and trends lasting longer than most investors give them credit for.  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality To avoid that eventual day of reckoning, which turns into something even painfully larger, I'd suggest using a trailing stop tied to the ZM stock's uptrend line. Beyond Meat (BYND)  Click to EnlargeThe third in our list of stocks to buy is the market's most recent IPO. Remember the Wendy's ad campaign, &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; Ironically enough and in the emerging trend of consumer and environmentally conscious eating, it's looking like it's in shares of Beyond Meat.Wall Street's bulls have been devouring BYND stock like there's no tomorrow since going public late last week at $25 a share. In fact, Thursday's debut marked the hottest IPO by a major U.S. company in nearly two decades. And shares of Beyond Meat are up roughly double their opening print in less than a week. It's a lot to be sure, but can we blame investors for their enthusiasm?Beyond Meat's protein-packed, plant-based meat alternatives offer consumers burgers, chicken and even sausage food products that are selling like hotcakes. And while this innovator will obviously face competition such as privately held Impossible Foods, the benefits of a healthier you, me and planet from buying into this incredibly important trend are beyond reproach and bode well for a first-mover like BYND stock.BYND stock has hit $82 in early trade Tuesday following Wall Street's first sell-side recommendation, &quot;new outperform&quot; from Bernstein and price target of $81. The firm sees the faux meat market growing to more than $40 billion over the next decade.On the price chart, the sizzle in the third of our stocks to buy is, however, a bit too well-done for our taste. With shares already piercing Bernstein's 12-month price target, having the patience to wait for a pullback is advised.No matter how delicious Beyond Meat products are or how exciting this obvious growth market might be, to avoid being grilled as a BYND stock investor, at a minimum I'd suggest waiting for those &quot;grill lines&quot; on the 30-minute chart to sear a few other bulls before buying shares.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Stay tuned this afternoon for coverage of everything Google announces. However, there's another big developer event less than a month away, and this one is the source of even more speculation. In the past, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) WWDC has seen the announcement of a wide range of products and services including the HomePod, Apple Music, the iPhone 3G, as well as previews of new versions of all AAPL's operating systems. Here's what to expect at WWDC 2019, which takes place on Monday June 3. Source: Apple  iOS 13 With a Focus on Speed and Bug FixesThe operating system that powers Apple iPads, iPhones and the iPod Touch is critical to Apple's success. Even after a record sales drop, the iPhone still accounted for over 53% of Apple revenue in the past quarter, while the iPad brought in nearly $4.9 billion. That makes iOS a significant factor in the performance of Apple stock. Get it right and it helps to drive mobile device sales, but slip up and the iPhone faces an even tougher uphill battle.  * 7 Stocks Worth Buying When They're Down Once again, Apple is expected to be playing it safe, focusing on speed and bug fixes that will make the iPhone and iPad seem zippier and more reliable. That doesn't mean there won't be new features, though. Predictions include a new Dark Mode for nighttime use, a redesigned Find My Phone app (that could leverage a Tile-like Bluetooth tracker the company is rumored to be working on), the ability to use an iPad as an external display with a Mac and updates to key apps including Maps, Reminders and Health.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MacOS 10.15Mac sales are down, and the latest version of macOS is one way Apple can try to reverse that trend. The big development for macOS in 2019 is expected to be the ability for Macs to run apps for the iPad (with support for iPhone apps expected net year). This project -- code-named &quot;Marzipan&quot; -- was first reported in 2018, but it's predicted to debut at WWDC 2019. Apple is expected to begin by porting several of its own iOS apps to the Mac, including Apple Music. WatchOS 6One of the stars of Apple's Q2 earnings was wearables. Apple stock can no longer rely on record iPhone sales for growth, but the Apple Watch is selling well. At WWDC 2019, the company will show off the latest version of watchOS, with plenty of new features. According to Bloomberg, a key development is expected to be App Store access directly from the smartwatch itself, allowing owners to download apps from their Apple Watch instead of relying on an iPhone. New apps are expected to include Calculator, Voice Memo and Books (for listening to audiobooks), and new health apps that will allow users to remind themselves to take pills and track their menstrual cycle.     tvOS 13After AAPL's March event where Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels were announced, we pretty much know what to expect from tvOS 13 -- support for Apple's new video streaming services. New HardwareThis is the one that AAPL investors are always watching for. New hardware can mean an uptick for Apple stock as customers rush to buy the latest device. WWDC 2019 is not a hardware-focused event, however the company has announced new hardware at this event in the past and it's possible we could see something onstage in June. At this point, the best bet is that Apple might bring out the all-new, modular Mac Pro it promised to its professional users. Accompanying it may be a return to the Mac Monitor business the company exited several years ago, with an expected 31.6-inch 6K display.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes Apple's WWDC 2019 keynote takes place on June 3.

4275,0.9355,"U.S. stock futures are trading lower this morning as elevated volatility continues to hound equities. The down open is dashing hopes that Monday's tariff-inspired plunge was a one-off. Volatility looks to remain for a spell.Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.63%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.65%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 0.78%.In the options pits, put volume made a comeback, almost dethroning calls as the victor for the day. Overall volume levels hung around average readings. Specifically, roughly 17.7 million calls and 17.2 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe put surge was enough to send the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio screaming back to 0.63, which lands it back inside its normal range. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.60.Options volumes fell well below Friday's high water mark. The following were three of the most popular stocks: Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).Let's take a closer look: Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Occidental Petroleum made a rare appearance on top of the most-active options board. The excitement was likely a result of two news events of note. First-quarter earnings topped the Street's expectations and signaled substantial growth compared to the same quarter last year. Second, OXY submitted a takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) that places it ahead of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which had previously offered a buyout deal.For the session, OXY stock rallied 1.4% on heavy volume. The technical posture looks like garbage with the company's shares submerged beneath falling moving averages. However, buyers did step up to defend a critical support area at $57. As long as the floor holds, you can keep your bounce hopes alive.On the options trading front, puts proved more popular than calls despite the rally. Activity swelled to 262% of the average daily volume, with 116,381 total contracts traded. Puts accounted for 58% of the tally.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes With the bidding war still in full swing, implied volatility remains lofty at 35%. That places it at the 57th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $1.30 or 2.2%. Apple (AAPL)Yesterday's rapid rebound after an ugly open impressed spectators. As soon as the morning bell rang, AAPL stock shot higher and continued to climb throughout the day. Buyers' defense of the rising 20-day moving average helps reaffirm the uptrend's dominance.As long as Monday's low of $203.50 holds, it's game on for bulls.Options trading volumes weren't all that high, but AAPL was still able to clinch the tenth and final spot atop Monday's leaderboard. Calls outpaced puts by a slim margin, helping to drive total activity to 87% of the average daily volume, with 466,826 contracts traded. Calls claimed 56% of the sum.The increased demand pushed implied volatility up to 23%, placing it at the 25th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $3.02 or 1.4%. Alibaba (BABA)Chinese stocks bore the brunt of yesterday's damage, but their recovery from the open was impressive. The weak open was particularly annoying for BABA stock because it reversed what was otherwise a healthy breakout last week. Fortunately, the intraday rebound kept its overall uptrend intact and pushed prices back above the 50-day and 20-day moving averages.With earnings looming so close on May 15, however, it's probably worth avoiding BABA trades until the uncertainty has passed.The action on the options trading front should encourage bulls. Calls ran the tables, claiming 72% of the total trading. Activity grew to 194% of the average daily volume, with 284,410 contracts traded.Implied volatility surged on the session to 38%, placing it at the 35th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $4.46 or 2.4%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

4382,0.9995,"It's time for us to take another bite at the Apple. Back in January, Apple, Inc. (AAPL – Research Report) CEO Tim Cook dialed back the guidance on the company’s Q1 earnings in a clever pre-emptive damage control move that simultaneously acknowledged declining sales revenue, lowered the earnings bar, and set the stage to meet or exceed that bar. In a classic example of Apple’s long game, Cook accepted a hit to the stock value early, in order to ameliorate the damage later. When Apple’s Q1 report turned out OK in light of the carefully managed expectations, the stage was set for last week’s Q2 beat.It’s fair to say that Tim Cook’s gambit has paid off. In April 30’s Q2 report, Apple met or exceeded expectations that were set at the end of Q1. The Q2 report justified management’s announcement earlier this year of a shift in focus toward services and user base monetization strategies. We’ll look at the news, and then dive into TipRanks’ analyst database to see what Wall Street has to say. Crunching Some NumbersFirst the headline numbers. Apple reported earnings of $2.46 per share, beating the forecast by 4%. Revenues came in 1% over the expectation, at $58 billion. Total revenues were down 5% from the year-ago quarter, but Cook primed us for that earlier this year. Investors shrugged it off, apparently, as AAPL shares jumped 5% after the Q2 earnings release.We can break down Apple’s revenues by segment, for a better look at where the company is heading. iPhone revenues, at $31.05 billion, were down 17% from last year’s Q2, and the Mac revenue of $5.51 billion also showed a decline. That was the bad news. Other segments were up, however, with gains that equaled or beat iPhone’s decline.The Services segment, on which Apple is staking its future, is up 16% to $11.45 billion quarterly revenues, iPad sales were up 19% to the segment’s best performance in 6 years, and the Wearables segment (which includes other accessories) showed a whopping 50% jump to $5.13 billion. While these gains did not fully offset the loss in iPhone revenue – the smartphones are, by sheer numbers, still Apple’s premier product and count for over 53% of total revenues – the pattern of gains and losses clearly shows how Apple is right to shift focus from the maturing iPhone market to the still-expanding Services, iPad, and Wearables.  Time to Monetize the BaseTim Cook stated that path clearly in his statements on the earnings: “Our March quarter results show the continued strength of our installed base of over 1.4 billion active devices, as we set an all-time record for Services, and the strong momentum of our Wearables, Home and Accessories category… We delivered our strongest iPad growth in six years, and we are as excited as ever about our pipeline of innovative hardware, software, and services.”This is all consistent with the ‘Show Time’ event that Cook hosted six weeks ago. The event – in effect, the flip side to early January’s guidance revision – introduced us to Apple’s overarching strategy to cope with both the maturing smartphone market and the possibility of economic slowdown in China, and the reduced iPhone sales that both portend. In short, it’s time for Apple to monetize the user base. Keep your eyes open this summer and fall; Apple will be releasing its Apple News+, Apple Card, AppleTV+, and Apple Arcade services. New models for the core products in the Mac and iPad lines have also been announced, and the company is developing to wireless earphone in the Wearables department. iPhone development will continue, but expect new products to release at a slower pace better suited to a 3- to 5-year replacement cycle.  Top Analysts AgreeMarket analysts agree that Apple shares are a buying prospect. Writing from Argus Research, five-star analyst Jim Kelleher (Track Record & Ratings) raised his price target by 11%, from $225 to $250. The new price target suggests an 18% upside potential to AAPL shares. Kelleher specifically pointed out “Apple’s high Services revenue in the quarter and the surge in its contribution from Wearables & Home segment.” He also noted the boost in confidence provided by “management's capital return program after Apple's expanded buyback and increased dividend announcements.”The capital return program cited by Kelleher was summed up by company CFO Luca Maestri: “Given our confidence in Apple’s future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, we’re also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount.” Since initiating dividend payments in 2012, Apple has made a consistent policy of rewarding shareholders. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva (Track Record & Ratings) also gave a bullish review of AAPL stock, saying, “Simply put Apple’s results and outlook across most metrics were clearly better than expected. As a result, both our and consensus estimates will move slightly higher…” Suva’s stance is less aggressive than Kelleher’s, and his price target of $220 indicates a more modest 4% upside.Since May 1, Apple has received 13 buy ratings from Wall Street’s best rated analysts as opposed to 10 holds, giving the stock a ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus rating. AAPL shares sell for $211 and have an average price target of $218; this gives the stock a modest, but real, upside of 3.26%.  This upside is in line with the stock’s recent history – it is important to bear in mind that as AAPL’s share price has risen quickly in recent months, it has developed a pattern of outpacing the analysts’ price targets.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail A Solid Smart ScoreThe buy ratings and price targets indicate a modestly bullish future for Apple, but they are not the only positive indicators. The TipRanks Smart Score brings together all of the data into one package, focusing on eight factors that are known to indicate future success. Apple gives us a particularly good example of the Smart Score in use, as it shows that a company need not have perfect ratings to achieve a high score. AAPL shares hold a Smart Score of 8, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market. Let’s break it down.On the debit side, we find that both insiders and investors have been selling Apple. A closer look shows that insider holdings are only down $255K in the last three months, while AAPL’s decline in investment portfolios is only 1%; while in the red, these numbers may also be indicative of profit taking as the stock has risen in recent weeks. Hedge fund activity presents a stronger negative on this stock.Turning to the credit side, we find plenty to outweigh the debits and give Apple its ‘Outperform’ rating.  We have already discussed the analyst consensus; the blogger and news sentiment are similarly bullish. Apple has been receiving great press, with 84% of the top financial bloggers and 82% of the news coverage giving a positive outlook. The final categories are the technicals and fundamentals, two different modes of stock analysis. On the technical side, the moving averages are trending up, giving a positive rating, while the one-year momentum shows AAPL shares up 20%. For the fundamentals, Apple’s 49% return on equity is clearly the key factor.View AAPL Smart Score Details Looking AheadApple takes an optimistic view of its near future, seeing revenues of $52.5 to $54.5 billion, with predicted gross margins of 37 to 38%. The company faces a serious challenge – lower sales in its flagship iPhone line – but has articulated a clear plan to meet it and initial results look promising. On a fundamental level, Apple still has those 1.4 billion active devices sold, translating to a loyal user base more than 1 billion strong.The TipRanks data shows that Apple management is right to be optimistic. A variety of indicators – from the human to the technical – point toward this stock outperforming the market. Enjoy the Research Report on the Stock in this Article:Apple, Inc.

4438,0.9661,"Warren Buffett, chief stock-picker for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), is one of the most successful investors of all time. Since 1964, when he assembled the group of companies that would eventually become Berkshire, the so-called Oracle of Omaha's baby has trounced the broad market's return. That is precisely why investors hunt down so-called &quot;Warren Buffett stocks&quot; in hopes of benefiting from his wisdom and discipline.But Buffett, who turned 88 last August, has become unable to keep up the pace of study needed to keep his fund's holdings optimized, and as a result, has stepped away complete control of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Other acolytes - namely, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - have emerged, and out of necessity have started making stock picks for Berkshire without necessarily requiring Buffett's blessing.Their selections aren't always divulged as non-Buffett picks. From a shareholder's perspective, Berkshire and its collective chiefs are one and the same, and reported as such. But sometimes it is clear that Warren Buffett had little-to-nothing to do with a particular holding.Here are six Berkshire Hathaway holdings that might not necessarily be &quot;Warren Buffett stocks.&quot; That's because they're out of character with the decades' worth of insight and tips he's been willing to dish out. More importantly: They might give us clues as to the direction of Berkshire's picks once Buffett is completely out of the picture.

4439,0.9927,"Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) did not just buy into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). One of Buffett's portfolio managers bought some Amazon stock.  That will show up in the company's next 13f filing, which investors scour like Kremlinologists for hints on what they should do.Source: Shutterstock But Buffett himself didn't buy Amazon stock. He likes to say he still doesn't understand technology.So, let's help him.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Buffett teaches through his annual letter to shareholders, let him now learn from the letter of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, released this week. Infrastructure Week and Amazon StockAmazon is not a &quot;phenomenon of nature,&quot; as Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger said recently. Amazon is a force of infrastructure, like a railroad. Clouds are infrastructure. Shared resources of any type are infrastructure. At Amazon, it's always Infrastructure Week.Jeff Bezos' most stupendous insight, headlined in his first 1997 investment letter, was that Amazon is an infrastructure company. His latest letter  illustrates the result of that insight -- 58% of Amazon's gross merchandise sales are now from independent, third-party sellers.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now &quot;Third parties are kicking our first party butt. Badly,&quot; he writes. They know their customers better than Amazon's sales algorithms know them. By giving third-party sellers access to all of Amazon's infrastructure -- its cloud, its transaction processing, its tax calculation, its warehousing and shipping -- these sellers can focus on what matters to them and to their retail customers.Clouds are the most important, and profitable, form of new infrastructure. Clouds, when used not just by those who built them but by everyone, drive up productivity and create deflation like nothing else we've seen. Now that its cloud infrastructure is largely in place, Amazon can bring nearly 30% of cloud revenue to the net income line.Once any critical infrastructure is in place, that becomes an enormous profit engine. In its first-quarter report, Amazon earned $3.56 billion, $7.09 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $59.7 billion. Sales were up 17%, but profits more than doubled, compared with a year earlier.It's this critical, privately owned infrastructure that made Sen. Elizabeth Warren put a target on Amazon's back. Bezos alludes to this in his letter, a topic I covered in my own newsletter this week. &quot;Retailing is no longer the monopoly Walmart (NYSE:WMT) threatened to make it 25 years ago,&quot; when the Web was first being spun, I wrote. &quot;The difference is Amazon.&quot; (Buffett recently sold out his Walmart position.) Scaling FailureThere's a second important point in Bezos' latest letter -- that failure should scale as well as success. &quot;If the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle,&quot; he writes. The Fire phone failed but Echo, the two-way speaker launched at the same time, became a huge success.Amazon's Alexa voice interface, which lives between the Echo and the Amazon cloud, has become a new kind of operating system. In the next decade, you might not find yourself bumping into people staring into their phones. You may find yourself bumping into people staring into space and talking seemingly to themselves as they interface with the Alexa operating system. As Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has learned, you can make serious coin with an operating system. The Bottom Line for AMZN StockI feel about Amazon much like Jim Cramer has long felt about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon is not a stock you trade. Amazon is a stock you own.Amazon's infrastructure delivers enormous opportunities for it to try things and make mistakes. Its spending on content was $1.7 billion last quarter, even though only half of Prime members watch what it streams, even though Apple and Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) continue to kick its butt in music streaming.Forget what Amazon will do with a promise of one-day Prime shipping. Think about what Amazon's business customers will do with it.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

4458,0.9952,"Last June I called Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) an &quot;interesting speculative play&quot;  and if you put money into ROKU stock then, you've been on a rollercoaster.Source: Roku Roku stock price more than doubled to $75 by October, at which point I said Roku was &quot;poised to retreat.&quot; By Christmas, the stock was down in the mid-20s. If you took my June advice but ignored October, you were unhappy.But there was another turnaround coming, and by February I noted that &quot;everybody suddenly loves Roku stock,&quot;  with the shares just below $50 each.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Everybody did love it, because by March Roku was at $70. It has since been bouncing around. Currently, ROKU trades around $64. So you might be wondering what I think the shares will do next. Pay AttentionThe point here isn't that I'm a stock price savant. The point is that Roku shares are highly volatile, driven by the shifting moods of traders, and you must pay careful attention to them.Generally, however, the direction of Roku stock has been up. Shares are up over 90% over the last year, even with last fall's collapse, and for good reason. Roku doubled its quarterly revenue from March to the end of the year, operating cash flow has been positive for three straight quarters, and there's no debt.Roku next reports May 8, and the number looks easy to beat. Revenues of $189 million, down by one-third from the Christmas quarter, and a loss of 24 cents per share is expected. Roku's business model is to sell streaming devices, then offer other streams and its own ad-based services on top of it. Rokus were a popular Christmas present, but you don't buy Christmas presents in February, so only part of the business is expected to be performing when Roku reports next month. Land of the GiantsRoku's ad business, meanwhile, lives in a land of giants, one where Roku's market cap of $7.1 billion is puny. The stick is offered directly against devices from Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten more serious about the business with Apple TV. The big cable operators, like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T), see streaming sticks as competitors, and everyone these days seems to have their own ad-supported streaming channel.Analysts, however, feel Roku is on firmer footing than before, a sure winner as consumers keep cutting their cable cords. Never mind that those cords are not being entirely cut. Those consumers are still on Internet service contracts, and the providers are not prevented from favoring their own offerings over any competitor.Even hedge fund operators, who are supposed to be smart, don't know what to do with Roku.  They got into it during its spectacular rise, but most stayed for the spectacular fall. The numbers are still coming in on how many got into the latest rise, but the stock's choppiness over the last month, down 10% from its early April high, indicates they're as confused as we are. The Bottom Line for Roku StockRoku remains a trader's stock, not a long-term investment. It's a stock you must pay attention to if you're to maximize your profit.But its fate seems clear. There are just too many big companies out there who might want it. These include the cable giants, the cloud czars and even some broadcasters desperate for a new way into consumer wallets.Personally, I think Roku would fit very nicely inside Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). But the valuation is still so low even CBS (NYSE:CBS), with a market cap of $19 billion, could afford it. Which means the auction, once it starts, should be fun.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now If I'm buying Roku stock today, the takeout is my payoff.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

4468,0.9808,"The Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges with an Apple Inc. vendor, the New Hampshire-based company GT Advanced Technologies Inc., and its former CEO for misleading investors about the company&apos;s ability to supply &quot;sapphire glass&quot; for Apple&apos;s iPhones. GT Advanced Technologies Inc., also allegedly misclassified more than $300 million in debt to Apple that resulted from its repeated failures to meet performance milestones. In the fall of 2013, according to the SEC, Apple agreed to advance $578 million in four installments to GT in exchange for sapphire glass that met certain technical standards. The agreement was closely watched by the market and highly material to GT&apos;s revenue, liabilities, and stock value. By late April 2014, GT had failed to meet the required standards, resulting in Apple withholding $139 million and giving it the right to accelerate repayment of $306 million previously advanced to GT. To avoid recognizing the debt as current, GT took an unsupported, undisclosed position that Apple had breached part of the agreement, thus releasing the company from the contract. However, then-CEO Thomas Gutierrez falsely stated in an earnings call that GT expected to hit performance targets and receive the last payment from Apple by October 2014. Gutierrez also provided unsupported sales projections, causing GT to misstate its second-quarter liquidity and non-GAAP earnings-per-share projections. Within two months, GT filed for bankruptcy and is now privately held. GT and Gutierrez consented to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations and Gutierrez agreed to pay more than $140,000.",0.09,0.716,0.194,1

Investors keep waiting for the predicted increase in revenue and earnings brought about by the rise of 5G. This latest report leaves many wondering if it will ever happen.Source: Shutterstock As a result, many see some of Nokia's peers as better investments. However, despite the struggles, a buy case for a specific type of investor remains. Lost Confidence and Nokia stockTo be sure, NOK stock has become a frustrating equity. I had taken a bullish on Nokia due to 5G. However, the latest earnings report has forced me to admit that the profit rollout has come more slowly than expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin wonders if those profits will ever appear. He believes Nokia suffers because of a trust problem within the Finland-based company.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May He may be right.Nokia has kept its guidance steady for both 2019 and 2020. But that also leaves investors wondering if 5G profits will actually start coming in the second half of the year.Nokia has missed opportunities since at least 2007. At that time, this leading cellphone company failed to see the future. As a result, it saw its business quickly evaporate soon after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its iPhone.Also, as Martin correctly points out, the merger with Alcatel-Lucent has met with declines in Nokia stock. The stock suffered further in March when the company revealed that some transactions with the Alcatel-Lucent division faced compliance issues.To its credit, NOK has transformed itself into a 5G equipment provider. However, it seems to lack the drive to succeed in its new industry. Political pressures have all but eliminated Huawei as an option in many countries. Unfortunately for investors in Nokia stock, the company has not benefitted from the reduced competition. Nokia Is Falling BehindOn the other hand, eliminating a major rival has boosted Ericsson's (NASDAQ:ERIC) numbers. Ericsson stock rose by 7.3% after it announced an earnings and revenue beat in its last quarterly report.Its 17.8 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio comes in higher. Still, that appears cheap in light of expected profit growth of more than 272% this year and a predicted 31.7% earnings increase in 2020.It also lags firms such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in other areas of networking. Double-digit profit growth, a 16.4 forward PE ratio, and the track record of dividend increases make Cisco a viable option. Dividend Investors and Nokia StockDespite these metrics from its peers, I see a case for buying Nokia stock, at least for dividend investors. The 24-cent per share annual dividend yields about 4.6% at current prices.Given the expected demand for 5G, I do not see Nokia's financials warranting a dividend cut. Moreover, it surpasses Cisco's yield of around 2.6% as well as Ericsson's which comes in at about 1.2%. The payout also gives investors some return even if it remains rangebound.Furthermore, Nokia's forward PE comes in at about 13. If it fulfills some of its potential as a 5G equipment provider, profits should finally rise. That could take it above $7 per share, a price level it has not surpassed since 2015. Concluding Thoughts on Nokia StockAmid the struggles, the buy case for Nokia remains lucrative for dividend investors. Nokia's latest earnings and revenue miss confirmed some long-held negative feelings about NOK stock.In recent weeks, compliance issues have weighed on NOK. Moreover, missing on revenue and earnings even with less competition has many investors perplexed. This has arguably made a case for investors to choose Ericsson or Cisco over Nokia.Nonetheless, Nokia leads its peers by a wide margin on dividend yields. Moreover, the rise of 5G will likely push NOK higher despite itself. Even if Nokia fails to produce stellar earnings reports, the cash payouts should keep dividend investors happy for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

4525,0.9977,"Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) reported Q1 earnings with some good news for investors. The company beat analyst expectations on revenue, sold 36% more devices than last year and saw its trackers post year-over-year unit growth for the first time in three years. Its Health Solutions business saw 70% growth. On a less positive note, ASP dropped and the company still lost 31 cents per share.Source: Fitbit Investors' reaction was mostly positive and Fitbit stock continued its 2019 roller coaster ride, closing up 1.7% and gaining an additional 2.4% in pre-market trading. However, it has since fallen back to earth, down 4.6% at the time of this writing.On May 1, Fitbit released its Q1 earnings report. For FIT investors there was more good news in there than they have become accustomed to hearing. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRevenue was up 10% year-over-year, and it was the result in sales growth across all the company's product lines. Even fitness trackers -- Fitbit says unit sales of its smartwatches grew 117% year-over-year. That's more than holding their own against the market leader Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch. In addition, sales for fitness trackers saw 17% growth on the year. That's worth spiking out because it marks the first time in three years that Fitbit has seen growth in this segment.In addition, the company's Health Solutions division, which InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer noted as a key factor in the potential for a Fitbit stock rally, saw year-over-year revenue growth of 70%.Overall, Fitbit sold 2.9 million devices in Q1 (up 36% year-over-year), which handily beat analyst expectations of 2 million. In addition, the $271.9 million in revenue for the quarter also exceeded the $259.7 million that analysts were projecting.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away The degree of growth in sales numbers and the surprise signs of life in the fitness trackers category naturally boosted Fitbit stock, which closed up 1.7% and has been trading up an additional 2.42% in the pre-market. But There Are Some Concerns While FIT's Q1 numbers had some real positives for the struggling company, they also revealed some potential causes for concern. Specifically average sales price (ASP). That number fell rather dramatically. And earnings, which remained in the red, with an average loss per share of 31 cents (although that was an improvement over the 34 cents loss per share in Q1 2018). When you look at the growth in devices and compare it to the growth in revenue, the numbers don't quite add up. You would expect the revenue numbers to be even higher. The reason they aren't is that Fitbit has begun to compete aggressively on price. The company introduced a new Inspire line of inexpensive fitness trackers earlier this year with prices starting at just $69.95 along with a stripped down version of its Versa smartwatch (the Versa Lite Edition) which has a $159.95 price tag.  * 7 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Slowing Economy Where analysts were looking for an ASP in the $109 range, Fitbit reported an ASP of $91 per device. The strategy of targeting value-conscious consumers has the potential to pay off. If Fitbit can keep growing unit sales this way, it can expand its platform and the growth in its user base would make the company's Health Solutions division more attractive to big clients like insurance companies.The downside is margins drop and the company has to sell a lot more devices to be profitable. The margin pressure was evident in the Q1 earnings report, which saw gross margins shrink from 46% a year ago to 32.9% in Q1 2019.Fitbit remains in a tough position. It's fighting for smartwatch market share against Apple and Samsung, and trying to re-ignite consumer interest in fitness trackers -a market where Xiaomi has become dominant by selling Mi bands starting at just $30. If the company's new strategy of cutting prices pays off with sustained sales growth and further inroads into the corporate health market, that will be good news for Fitbit stock. If not, FIT investors can expect the roller coaster ride to continue.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The metrics are just as positive for Square stock competitors too.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)But, SQ reported earnings last night and got slammed down 5% on the headline. The dive continued this morning, with Square stock falling another 5% from the open.SQ beat both the top and bottom lines, but they guided weaker on both going forward. This is an unforgivable sin on Wall Street these days, and investors are punishing Square stock &quot;appropriately.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong other points of contention, SQ management reported a lower gross payment volume than expected. The bears really sunk their teeth into this highlight.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away Meanwhile, CEO Jack Dorsey's message was that the company is still on target to grow its ecosystem. This is a term that works for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) so perhaps it will for SQ eventually, but it hasn't yet.In reality, after the success of Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) earnings, investors expect the same from Square. So this exaggerates the disappointment when the results are not ideal. This is the opposite of what happened with AAPL's earnings situation. Wednesday's rip was perhaps bigger as investors sigh of relief that AAPL earnings were not as bad as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).What didn't help matters for SQ? CFO Amrita Ahuja noted that they will reinvest back into the business. This is code for they will spend a lot of money in order to keep up. Square does face formidable competition from PYPL, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) so they have to spend to compete.The exciting part about SQ is that it's the new kid on the block. But as it grows it will come into face to face competitive situation with these behemoths. So this is merely an adjustment period and should not change the overall bullish thesis. Management has been executing on plans well to earn our trust and nothing in this report tells us otherwise yet. Trading Square StockSo is this the right time to catch the falling knife? No, but it depends on the time frames of individual investors.So if I am long the stock I don't panic out of it. There is support relief below these levels even after the dip. The zone around $65 per share has been pivotal for almost a year. This should act as support on the way down.Areas of contentions like this are where both bulls and bears agree on value so they fight it out hard. This creates a stall which in this case would be support. This is not a hard line in the sand but rather a zone. So even though a big dip of this size usually is not a one day event, the selling will abate the deeper SQ goes into the pivotal zone. Even if it fails, there is another one just $5 below it.Furthermore, there still is a bullish pattern in play that suggests that SQ stock is targeting $92 per share and this dip doesn't yet kill it. As long as the dip doesn't accelerate the upside scenario is still viable. I do have to admit that this dip severely reduces the odds of it working out this coming quarter.Square stock is not cheap as it sells at nine times sales. But this is not absolutely nuts as it is in line with say Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Visa and MasterCard actually trade at 16 times sales but they have the benefit of running a huge profit. SQ still is not profitable.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May In the long term, Square is likely to get its act together. They operate in a booming area of electronic payments. The whole world is in the middle of a revolution that is determined to migrate all transaction to electronic format. So as long as management stays on task any serious dip is a buying opportunity of Square stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

4538,0.9975,"Apple (AAPL) reported a surprisingly solid quarter with the company delivering above expectations on both revenue and dil. EPS. Specifically, the tech giant reported revenue of $58.015 billion and dil. EPS of $2.46, beating to consensus estimates of $57.37 billion and dil. EPS of $2.36. Investors reacted positively to the earnings beat, bidding up the stock nearly 7% in Wednesday's trading session.Apple also provided guidance for the quarter ending June 30 2019 for &quot;revenue between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion Gross margin between 37 percent and 38 percent. Operating expenses between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. Other income/(expense) of $250 million and tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent.”Revenue outlook of $52.5 billion-$54.5 billion beat consensus estimates of $51.93 billion at both the low-end and high-end of the range. Apple also announced an additional “$75 billion for share repurchases and Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 5 percent.”It was a toss-up quarter, but with results that beat expectations overall despite weakness in smartphone and computer sales. iPhone revenue declined y/y -17.3% from $37.559 billion (Q2’18) to $31.051 billion (Q2’19), iMac sales declined by -4.5% from $5.775 billion to $5.513 billion. The weakness tied to smartphones and desktop/notebook computers conforms with the weak results reported by peers. Both smartphone and computer shipments are expected to decline this year according to global unit forecasts.Apple’s quarter was viewed as a success, because it was less dependent on smartphone sales to sustain topline results. iPad revenue grew from $4 billion to $4.872 billion representing +21.8% y/y growth, wearables, home and accessories also grew from $3.944 billion to $5.129 billion representing +30% y/y growth, and Services also grew from $9.85 billion to $11.45 billion adding +16% y/y growth.Despite the significant drop-off in iPhone revenues -17.3% y/y, Apple itself reported a more modest -5.1% y/y decline in revenue. Apple’s other business segments offset some of the weakness in smartphone results, which positions Apple favorably when smartphone results start to improve.Luca Maestri (CFO) also mentioned on the earnings call, that the financial terms of the agreement with Qualcomm will not be discussed. But, financial outlook for gross margin of 37% to 38% does reflect the impact from the Qualcomm agreement. Tim Cook (CEO) also mentioned that a number of new services will contribute to service revenue growth, such as Apple News+, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Card. On-going service revenue ramp will offset some of the weakness in smartphone/PC revenue.Daniel Ives from Wedbush Securities mentioned in a note on Tuesday following Apple’s earnings announcement:&gt; In a nutshell, the company beating the Street and most importantly guiding stronger for June will put &quot;major fuel in the engine&quot; for the bulls tomorrow morning and ultimately put shares on a path to make new highs in our opinion over the next 3 to 6 months. The skeptics continue to scratch their heads at the meteoric move in Apple's stock since early January lows and this report/guidance is just another major step in the right direction for Cook and Cupertino as they navigate near-term turbulence in China which appears to be slowly abating. We maintain our OUTPERFORM rating and $225 price target.Overall, Apple’s Q2’19 results, and financial guidance painted a much better forecast than what investors were anticipating. Assuming, the smartphone-cycle shows patterns of recovery, the return to revenue growth will keep bulls optimistic. WWDC 2019 in June and the pre-launch iPhone events could add upside to shares. Investors have reset expectations tied to a smartphone turnaround until next-year with near-term financial results strong enough to keep investors onboard.If you liked this article, you should check out the Top Nasdaq Stocks section on Smarter Analyst.

But the company committed the cardinal sin of earnings reports and guided lower because of weakness in their China business.Source: Shutterstock These days Wall Street is so obsessed with the forecast that management reports for future quarters that it's almost like they don't care about the actual results. So in theory, investors are punishing the companies that like to under promise and over deliver.Luckily for the bulls, coming into the earnings event, Qualcomm stock was near an all-time high and close to its Dot Com bubble level. It came into it up 52% year-to-date, which is double that of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). So the price action setup favored the downside scenario.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn fact, I actually shorted the event via a put position. This wasn't a knock against the company's prospects but rather betting on the binary event reaction. QCOM management is competent so I knew they would beat the expectations. But I felt that the prices demanded perfection from the report.Before you label me a hater, I wrote about going long QCOM stock as it showed relative strength in early March. The trade paid very well so I am not a perma-bear. I trade around the price action.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away So is it a good place to catch the falling knife? Not yet.Recently, the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settlement headline caused an insane rally in QCOM stock. The downside of having had that spike is that it sets up the potential for serious disappointment. Those who recently bought the rally are weak hands and they will sell out of their positions very fast at the first sign of trouble.So there is not a strong footing anywhere near these levels, even after the dip on the headline. There is very delicate support around $80 per share, but then there is the pull from a massive gap to $71 per share.Although this is not a forecast, this dip could target filling the gap. This is a viable scenario that could unfold here, especially if the markets continue to fall like they did Wednesday afternoon. Bottom Line on QCOM StockThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spooked equity investors as he refused to commit to cutting rates. This is a silly request from the traders, nevertheless, it caused real price action. So if the tizzy lingers, then the QCOM stock dip will too.This also depends on the trader time frame. If the intent is to own QCOM shares for a really long time, then you can nibble down 5%. But for most traders who prefer starting out green, I'd wait out the first down candle, especially when it's this big.  * 7 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Slowing Economy The fundamentals are relatively healthy for QCOM. But the stock is not cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 56X. So there is a bit of froth it can shed. But we learned that the company will get about $4.5 billion from Apple, so that should go a long way toward supporting the stock price action this week.Technically, there should be support before QCOM stock fills the gap below; $76 per share was pivotal from last September, so it should provide support on the way down. Both bulls and bears will want to fight it out hard thereby creating price congestion.In the long run, QCOM stock will rise with the stock market. This is a successful company that just settled its dispute with the largest company on the planet. And it will continue to be successful. So there is no reason to short QCOM's future and the stock will recover after the earnings tizzy is done.The better entry points into the stock would be at pivot zones and those are at $80, $76 or $68.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.
